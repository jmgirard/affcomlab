## Research Framework

### Substantive Pillars

The substantive focus of our work is on how humans communicate important affective and interpersonal information to one another. The four pillars of this work are on structure, context, dynamics, and functionality. In studying **structure**, we investigate the production and perception of visual behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and body motion), vocal behaviors (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre), and verbal behaviors (e.g., syntax, semantics, and discourse). In studying **context**, we investigate the influence of cultural, relational, and situational factors. In studying **dynamics**, we investigate change over time, regulation, and how processes and individuals influence one another. Finally, in studying **functionality**, we investigate how communication interfaces with health, clinical assessment, and treatment.

### Methodological Foundation

Supporting these pillars is a wide foundation of interdisciplinary methodology. The three main aspects of this foundation are statistics, computing, and open science. The **statistical** aspects largely focus on Bayesian estimation, multilevel (mixed-effects) modeling, and measurement validation. The **computational** aspects largely focus on data science (data wrangling and visualization), behavior sensing (computer vision, signal processing, and natural language processing), and artificial intelligence (machine learning and large language models). Finally, the **open science** aspects largely focus on research software, research databases, and educational resources.

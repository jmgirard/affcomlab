Yet our understanding of how alcohol impacts emotion as assessed across diverse response modalities remains incomplete. The present study leverages a social alcohol-administration paradigm to assess drinking-related emotions, aiming to elucidate impacts of intoxication on self-reported versus behaviorally expressed emotion. Method: Participants (N = 60; Mage = 22.5; 50\\% male; 55\\% White) attended two counterbalanced laboratory sessions, on one of which they were administered an alcoholic beverage (target blood alcohol content .08\\%) and on the other a nonalcoholic control beverage. Participants in both conditions were accurately informed of beverage contents and consumed study beverages in assigned groups of three while their behavior was videotaped. Emotion was assessed via self-report as well as continuous coding of facial muscle movements. Results: The relationship between self-reported and behaviorally expressed emotion diverged significantly across beverage conditions: positive affect: b = -0.174, t = -2.36, p = .022; negative affect, b = 0.4319, t = 2.37, p = .021. Specifically, self-reports and behavioral displays converged among sober but not intoxicated participants. Further, alcohol's effects on positive facial displays remained significant in models controlling for self-reported positive and negative emotion, with alcohol enhancing Duchenne smiles 20\\% beyond effects captured via self-reports, pointing to unique effects of alcohol on behavioral indicators of positive emotion. Conclusions: Findings highlight effects of acute intoxication on the convergence and divergence of emotion measures, thus informing our understanding of measures for capturing emotions that are most proximal to drinking and thus most immediately reinforcing of alcohol consumption.

Computational approaches offer new opportunities to analyze expressive behavior (e.g., facial expressions, vocal prosody, and language use) with greater precision and efficiency. This paper provides an accessible conceptual framework for understanding how methods from computer vision, speech signal processing, and natural language processing can enhance clinical assessment. We outline the goals, frameworks, and methods of both clinical and computational approaches, and present an illustrative review of interdisciplinary research applying these techniques across a range of mental health conditions. We also examine key challenges related to data quality, measurement, interdisciplinarity, and ethics. Finally, we highlight future directions for building systems that are robust, interpretable, and clinically meaningful. This review is intended to support dialogue between clinical and computational communities and to guide ongoing research and development at their intersection.\n@article{girard2025,\n  title = {Computational Analysis of Expressive Behavior in Clinical Assessment},\n  author = {Jeffrey M Girard and Dasha A Yermol and Albert Ali Salah and Jeffrey F Cohn},\n  year = {2025},\n  journal = {Annual Review of Clinical Psychology},\n  doi = {10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081423-024140}\n}\n\n\n\n\nDepressive Symptoms among Hispanic Americans: Investigating the Interplay of Acculturation and Demographics\n\n\nRincon Caicedo, Girard, Punt, Giovanetti & Ilardi\n\nJournal of Latinx Psychology\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nAs with many other racial and ethnic minorities, Hispanic Americans face substantial disparities in health care access and disease prevalence. The published literature on mental health disorders among Hispanic individuals, however, is not robust, and their experience of depressive disorders remains poorly understood. The construct of acculturation may help elucidate the risk of depression among Hispanic Americans and may inform the development of appropriate policy and treatment resources. We examined the degree to which acculturation may interact with key demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status [SES], and Mexican ancestry) in accounting for depressive symptomatology among Hispanic Americans. We conducted a series of Bayesian generalized linear mixed models using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to investigate the self-reported depressive symptomatology (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) of Mexican Americans and other Hispanic individuals and to examine possible effects of acculturation and demographics on depressive symptomatology in this population. Mexican Americans had substantially lower levels of depression than other Hispanic individuals. Acculturation was positively associated with depression severity, but this effect was moderated by sex and SES. High acculturation was more strongly linked to depression among men and those of high SES. Acculturation and several demographic factors were associated with depressive symptomatology among Hispanic individuals. Acculturation can be useful in understanding risk, developing culturally informed interventions, and implementing community-level changes to address the burden of Hispanic depression.

We sought to clarify these relationships by applying more sophisticated dynamic and dyadic methods. Method: Adult outpatients with depression (N=65, Age 18-64, 65\\% Female, 68\\% White) participated in up to eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal psychotherapy. Sessions occurred either in-person or via teletherapy and were video-recorded. Facial computing tools estimated the momentary intensity of patients' and therapists' scowling and smiling, and the interpersonal synchrony of these measures during each session was quantified using windowed cross-correlation analyses. Hypotheses about within-dyad processes (i.e., session-to-session changes) and between-dyad associations (i.e., of average tendencies) were tested using hierarchical Bayesian mediation models. Results: Numerous and nuanced associations were found between facial behavior, working alliance, and treatment outcomes (e.g., session-to-session increases in patient-rated working alliance were predicted by higher-than-average therapist smiling). Interpersonal synchrony did not predict within-dyad changes in working alliance or depression symptoms; however, on the between-dyad level, higher average patient-rated working alliance was predicted by both higher average smile synchrony and lower average scowl synchrony. Conclusions: The facial behavior of patients and therapists provides a valuable window into the therapeutic process, especially with regard to the alliance. Contributions come from the behaviors of each person as well as their level of interpersonal synchrony. However, contrary to extant theories, the associations of synchrony with working alliance and outcomes depend on the behavior being synchronized, the informant providing ratings, and the level of analysis being conducted. Public Health Significance: These results help refine clinical theories about psychotherapy and unlock new possibilities for computationally assessing its progress.\n@article{girard2025a,\n  title = {Dynamic and Dyadic Relationships between Facial Behavior, Working Alliance, and Treatment Outcomes during Depression Therapy},\n  author = {Jeffrey M Girard and Dasha A Yermol and Lauren M Bylsma and Jeffrey F Cohn and Jay C Fournier and Louis-Philippe Morency and Holly A Swartz},\n  year = {2025},\n  journal = {Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}\n}\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESS: How Influencers Grow: An Empirical Study and Future Research Agenda\n\n\nCampbell, Girard, McDuff & Rosengren\n\nJournal of Interactive Marketing\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nMost research on influencers takes the perspective of marketers, examining how influencers can be leveraged to build brands. However, as influencers grow in popularity, they are becoming a marketing force in their own right, warranting deeper exploration from their perspective. This paper shifts the focus to influencers as active marketers, using a multilevel mixed-effects growth model to identify factors associated with follower growth. Analyzing a dataset of 14,311,145 pieces of Instagram content posted over more than two years from 6,079 influencers across 57 countries, we examine how attention labor (content strategy and persona appeal) and relationship labor (captioning strategy and ecosystem connectivity) relate to follower growth. Whereas existing research primarily focuses on engagement with specific pieces of content, this study takes a broader approach, investigating how influencers' content and engagement strategies are associated with differences in follower growth over time. By reframing influencers as marketers rather than media vehicles, this study contributes to marketing theory and provides insights for influencers, influencer agencies, and marketers who seek to better understand influencer growth.\n@article{campbell2025,\n  title = {{{EXPRESS}}: {{How}} Influencers Grow: An Empirical Study and Future Research Agenda},\n  author = {Colin Campbell and Jeffrey M.

A multimodal approach provides a more comprehensive understanding than any single modality (type of collected information) can provide on its own. Traditionally, clinicians and researchers have relied on their intuition, experience, and training to integrate different types of information in a psychotherapy session/treatment. Increasingly, however, computational methods offer a complementary alternative, enabling more automated, data-driven, and reproducible solutions. The six empirical examples in this special section illustrate the emerging---and often interdisciplinary---methodologies, including text, audio, video, and physiological measures, that are relevant in the psychotherapy setting. While each study addressed distinct research questions and employed unique methodologies, they all demonstrated a commitment to leveraging multimodal measurement and tackling the challenges of integrating diverse data sources.\n@article{aafjes-vandoorn2025,\n  title = {From Intuition to Innovation: Empirical Illustrations of Multimodal Measurement in Psychotherapy Research},\n  author = {Katie {Aafjes-van Doorn} and Jeffrey M.

The social-personality conceptualization of narcissism often emphasizes high self-esteem as well as a range of associated maladaptive and adaptive outcomes. The clinical literature focuses on the pathological aspects of narcissism and highlights maladaptive aspects that correspond to the relationship between narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability. Reflecting these varying views of narcissism, many measures have become popular in the assessment of the construct, each with varying interpersonal characterizations. The current study (N\\,=\\,1,111) evaluated the interpersonal profiles captured by popular measures of narcissism and examined whether measures capture overlapping, differentiated, and/or intended interpersonal styles. Results revealed that measures of narcissism capture a wide range of interpersonal styles, from warm/dominant to submissive. However, most measures emphasize the role of interpersonal dominance in the measure content. Viewing narcissism from a three-factor structure, including narcissistic agency, antagonism, and vulnerability, helps to integrate the wide range of interpersonal styles apparent across narcissism measures. Furthermore, the level of (mal)adaptivity and general interpersonal style somewhat maps onto the literature of origin for the scales. Implications for measurement selection in the assessment of narcissism are discussed.\n@article{edershile2025,\n  title = {Narcissism from Every Angle: An Interpersonal Analysis of Narcissism in Young Adults},\n  author = {Elizabeth A.

To develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end, we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over 4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents, telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents. Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.\n@misc{agrawal2025,\n  title = {Seamless Interaction: {{Dyadic}} Audiovisual Motion Modeling and Large-Scale Dataset},\n  author = {Vasu Agrawal and Akinniyi Akinyemi and Kathryn Alvero and Morteza Behrooz and Julia Buffalini and Fabio Maria Carlucci and Joy Chen and Junming Chen and Zhang Chen and Shiyang Cheng and Praveen Chowdary and Joe Chuang and Antony D'Avirro and Jon Daly and Ning Dong and Mark Duppenthaler and Cynthia Gao and Jeff Girard and Martin Gleize and Sahir Gomez and Hongyu Gong and Srivathsan Govindarajan and Brandon Han and Sen He and Denise Hernandez and Yordan Hristov and Rongjie Huang and Hirofumi Inaguma and Somya Jain and Raj Janardhan and Qingyao Jia and Christopher Klaiber and Dejan Kovachev and Moneish Kumar and Hang Li and Yilei Li and Pavel Litvin and Wei Liu and Guangyao Ma and Jing Ma and Martin Ma and Xutai Ma and Lucas Mantovani and Sagar Miglani and Sreyas Mohan and Louis-Philippe Morency and Evonne Ng and Kam-Woh Ng and Tu Anh Nguyen and Amia Oberai and Benjamin Peloquin and Juan Pino and Jovan Popovic and Omid Poursaeed and Fabian Prada and Alice Rakotoarison and Rakesh Ranjan and Alexander Richard and Christophe Ropers and Safiyyah Saleem and Vasu Sharma and Alex Shcherbyna and Jia Shen and Jie Shen and Anastasis Stathopoulos and Anna Sun and Paden Tomasello and Tuan Tran and Arina Turkatenko and Bo Wan and Chao Wang and Jeff Wang and Mary Williamson and Carleigh Wood and Tao Xiang and Yilin Yang and Julien Yao and Chen Zhang and Jiemin Zhang and Xinyue Zhang and Jason Zheng and Pavlo Zhyzheria and Jan Zikes and Michael Zollhoefer},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {arXiv:2506.22554 [cs.CV]}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Effects of Alcohol in Groups of Heavy-Drinking Young Adults: A Multimodal Investigation of Alcohol Responses in a Laboratory Social Setting\n\n\nCreswell, Wright, Sayette, Girard, Lyons & Smyth\n\nClinical Psychological Science\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nYoung adults typically drink socially, yet most lab studies testing alcohol responses have administered alcohol in isolation. This is the first study to examine alcohol responses and social reward in a group setting among a young-adult at-risk sample. Heavy-drinking young adults (N = 393; 50\\% female) were grouped in threes and drank a moderate dose of alcohol or a placebo beverage. These social interactions were recorded, and the duration and sequence of facial expressions, speech, and laughter were coded. Results revealed a comprehensive, multimodal, positive effect of alcohol on socioemotional experiences across self-report (e.g., increased positive affect and social bonding, greater relief of unpleasant feelings) and behavioral outcomes at both the individual (e.g., more rapid increases in Duchenne smiling) and group levels (e.g., more three-way conversations). Findings underscore the potential for group-formation paradigms to yield valuable data regarding etiological mechanisms underlying alcohol use disorder.

Due to their strong reinforcing properties, HPF are hypothesized to lead to greater energy intake within a meal. However, this premise has not been tested in free-living conditions. The current study examined the association between within-meal HPF intake and 1) measured energy intake and 2) self-reported overeating, assessed within eating occasions using smartphone-based food photography methodology. Methods A total of 29 participants reported food intake and eating experiences (N=345 total eating occasions) in real-time for 4~days using smartphone-based food photography methodology. HPF were identified using a standardized definition. Bayesian multilevel modeling was conducted to investigate the within-person effects of proportional calorie intake from HPF (\\%kcal from HPF) on total energy intake and subjective overeating. Pre-meal hunger and proportional energy intake from high energy dense (HED) foods were included as covariates. Results Results revealed that when participants consumed more \\%kcal from HPF than their average, they consumed greater total energy during eating occasions, even when controlling for pre-meal hunger and \\%kcal from HED foods (median {$\\beta~$}=~0.09, 95\\% HDI [0.02, 0.16], pd.~=~99.56\\%). Additionally, consuming more \\%kcal from HPF than average was associated with greater eating despite feeling full, when controlling covariates (median {$\\beta~$}=~0.15, 95\\% HDI [-0.02, 0.34], pd~=~96.45\\%). Conclusions The findings supported the premise that HPF themselves may yield greater energy intake and eating despite satiation, measured in real-time and free-living conditions.\n@article{jun2025,\n  title = {The Role of Hyper-Palatable Foods in Energy Intake Measured Using Mobile Food Photography Methodology},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Jeffrey M.

This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, utilizing clinical ratings collected from patients with either affective or nonaffective psychoses ( n = 1,042). Drawing from established clinical instruments, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Montgomery-{\\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale, a broad spectrum of core psychotic symptoms was considered for the model development. Among the candidate models considered, including correlated factors and multifactor models, a model with seven correlated factors encompassing positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, mania, disorganization, hostility, and anxiety was most interpretable with acceptable fit. The seven factors exhibited expected associations with external validators, were replicable through cross-validation, and were generalizable across affective and nonaffective psychoses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) The aim of this study is to formulate a transdiagnostic dimensional model by integrating well-established clinical ratings that encompass a wide range of core symptoms observed in both affective and nonaffective psychoses. We demonstrate that a multidimensional symptom model representing both psychotic (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and disorganization) and mood symptoms (depression, mania, hostility, and anxiety) is most interpretable and applicable across psychotic diagnoses. Considering the complex interrelationships among identified symptom dimensions, a dimensional approach may be more suitable for characterizing the symptom profiles of psychotic patients than a categorical diagnostic approach.

Some of this information is structured, while some is unstructured. Yet most studies of multiattribute decisions focus on decisions made from structured information. This study evaluated how structured and unstructured information is used within graduate admissions decisions. We examined a uniquely comprehensive data set of N = 2,231 graduate applications to the University of Kansas, containing full application packages, demographics, and final admissions decisions for each applicant. To make sense of our documents, we applied structural topic modeling (STM), a topic model that allows topic content and prevalence to covary based on other metadata (e.g., department of study). STM allowed us to examine what information the letters and statements contain and the relationships between variables like gender and race and the textual information. We found that most topics in the unstructured data related to specific fields of study. The STMs did not uncover strong differences among applicants regarding race and gender, though the recommendation letters and personal statements for international applicants did show some different topic profiles than domestic applicants. We also found that admissions decision makers behaved as if they prioritized structured numeric metrics, using unstructured information to check for disqualifications, if at all.

Findings from Two Clinical Trials of Exposure for Eating Disorders\n\n\nButler, Christian, Girard, Vanzhula & Levinson\n\nBehaviour Research and Therapy\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nObjective Imaginal exposure is a novel intervention for eating disorders (EDs) that has been investigated as a method for targeting ED symptoms and fears. Research is needed to understand mechanisms of change during imaginal exposure for EDs, including whether within- and between-session distress reduction is related to treatment outcomes. Method Study 1 tested four sessions of online imaginal exposure (N~=~143). Study 2 examined combined imaginal and in vivo exposure, comprising six imaginal exposure sessions (N~=~26). ED symptoms and fears were assessed pre- and posttreatment, and subjective distress and state anxiety were collected during sessions. Results Subjective distress tended to increase within-session in both studies, and within-session reduction was not associated with change in ED symptoms or fears. In Study 1, between-session reduction of distress and state anxiety was associated with greater decreases in ED symptoms and fears pre-to posttreatment. In Study 2, between-session distress reduction occurred but was not related to outcomes. Conclusions Within-session distress reduction may not promote change during exposure for EDs, whereas between-session distress reduction may be associated with better treatment outcomes. These findings corroborate research on distress reduction during exposure for anxiety disorders. Clinicians might consider approaches to exposure-based treatment that focus on distress tolerance and promote between-session distress reduction.\n@article{butler2024,\n  title = {Are Within- and between-Session Changes in Distress Associated with Treatment Outcomes? {{Findings}} from Two Clinical Trials of Exposure for Eating Disorders},\n  author = {Rachel M.

Linking PTSD symptoms to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology may enable researchers and clinicians to understand the patterns and breadth of behavioral sequelae following traumatic experiences that may be shared with other psychiatric disorders. To explore this premise, we recruited a trauma-exposed online community sample (N = 462) and measured dimensional transdiagnostic traits of psychopathology using parceled facets derived from the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Faceted--Short Form. PTSD symptom factors were measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and derived using confirmatory factor analysis according to the seven-factor hybrid model (i.e., Intrusions, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, Anxious Arousal, And Dysphoric Arousal). We observed hypothesized associations between PTSD factors and transdiagnostic traits indicating that some transdiagnostic dimensions were associated with nearly all PTSD symptom factors (e.g., emotional lability: rmean = .35), whereas others showed more unique relationships (e.g., hostility--Externalizing Behavior: r = .60; hostility with other PTSD factors: rs = .12--.31). All PTSD factors were correlated with traits beyond those that would appear to be construct-relevant, suggesting the possibility of indirect associations that should be explicated in future research. The results indicate the breadth of trait-like consequences associated with PTSD symptom exacerbation, with implications for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Although PTSD is not a personality disorder, the findings indicate that increased PTSD factor severity is moderately associated with different patterns of trait-like disruptions in many areas of functioning.\n@article{sprunger2024,\n  title = {Associations between Transdiagnostic Traits of Psychopathology and Hybrid Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Factors in a Trauma-Exposed Community Sample},\n  author = {Joel G.

However, it remains unclear whether types of environmental reinforcement (e.g., social or work) may differentially influence use. This study tested the association between types of environmental reinforcement and engagement in multiple health risk behaviors (alcohol use, binge eating, and nicotine use). Cross-sectional data were collected from a general population sample of US adults (N = 596). The Pleasant Events Schedule (PES) was used to measure sources of reinforcement. Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) characterized different areas of environmental reinforcement and correlations with alcohol consumption, binge eating, and nicotine use. A four-factor structure of the PES demonstrated a conceptually cohesive model with acceptable fit and partial strict invariance. Social-related reinforcement was positively associated with alcohol consumption ({$\\beta$} = 0.30, p {$&lt;$} 0.001) and binge eating ({$\\beta$} = 0.26, p {$&lt;$} 0.001). Work/school-related reinforcement was negatively associated with binge eating ({$\\beta$} = -0.14, p = 0.006). No areas of reinforcement were significantly associated with nicotine use (p values = 0.069 to 0.755). Social-related activities may be associated with engagement in multiple health risk behaviors (more binge eating and alcohol use), whereas work/school-related activities may be preventative against binge eating. Understanding these relationships can inform prevention efforts targeting health risk behaviors.\n@article{linsalata2024,\n  title = {Sources of Environmental Reinforcement and Engagement in Health Risk Behaviors among a General Population Sample of {{US}} Adults},\n  author = {Alexa M.

In contrast to previous work in Affective Computing, which pursued a single ``ground truth'' label for the affective content of each moment of each video (e.g., by averaging the ratings of 2 to 7 trained participants), we embrace the subjectivity inherent to emotional experiences and provide the full distribution of all participants' ratings (with an average of 76.7 raters per video). We argue that this choice represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock new research directions, generate new hypotheses, and inspire novel methods in the Affective Computing community. We also describe several interdisciplinary use cases for the database: to provide dynamic norms for emotion elicitation studies (e.g., in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience), to train and test affective content analysis algorithms (e.g., for dynamic emotion recognition, video summarization, and movie recommendation), and to study subjectivity in emotional reactions (e.g., to identify moments of emotional ambiguity or ambivalence within movies, identify predictors of subjectivity, and develop personalized affective content analysis algorithms).

However, less is known about the conditions under which the dynamic advantage occurs. The aim of this research was to test emotion recognition in static and dynamic facial expressions, thereby exploring the role of three featural parameters (prototypicality, ambiguity and complexity) in human and machine analysis. In two studies, facial expression videos and corresponding images depicting the peak of the target and non-target emotion were presented to human observers and the machine classifier (FACET). Results revealed higher recognition rates for dynamic stimuli compared to non-target images. Such benefit disappeared in the context of target-emotion images which were similarly well (or even better) recognised than videos, and more prototypical, less ambiguous, and more complex in appearance than non-target images. While prototypicality and ambiguity exerted more predictive power in machine performance, complexity was more indicative of human emotion recognition. Interestingly, recognition performance by the machine was found to be superior to humans for both target and non-target images. Together, the findings point towards a compensatory role of dynamic information, particularly when static-based stimuli lack relevant features of the target emotion. Implications for research using automatic facial expression analysis (AFEA) are discussed.\n@article{kim2023,\n  title = {Human and Machine Recognition of Dynamic and Static Facial Expressions: Prototypicality, Ambiguity, and Complexity},\n  author = {Hyunwoo Kim and Dennis K{\\\"u}ster and Jeffrey M.

This is especially important in certain applications, such as psychotherapy, where individualized tracking of behavior patterns can provide valuable information about the patient's mental state. Conventional methods that rely on aggregate statistics and correlational metrics may not always suffice, as they are often unable to capture causal relationships or evaluate the true probability of identified patterns. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach to learning multimodal and interpersonal representations of behavior dynamics during one-on-one interaction. Our approach is enabled by the introduction of a multiview extension of latent change score models, which facilitates the concurrent capture of both inter-modal and interpersonal behavior dynamics and the identification of directional relationships between them. A core advantage of our approach is its high level of interpretability while simultaneously achieving strong predictive performance. We evaluate our approach within the domain of therapist-client interactions, with the objective of gaining a deeper understanding about the collaborative relationship between the two, a crucial element of the therapeutic process. Our results demonstrate improved performance over conventional approaches that rely upon summary statistics or correlational metrics. Furthermore, since our multiview approach includes the explicit modeling of uncertainty, it naturally lends itself to integration with probabilistic classifiers, such as Gaussian process models. We demonstrate that this integration leads to even further improved performance, all the while maintaining highly interpretable qualities. Our analysis provides compelling motivation for further exploration of stochastic systems within computational models of behavior.\n@inproceedings{vail2023,\n  title = {Representation Learning for Interpersonal and Multimodal Behavior Dynamics: A Multiview Extension of Latent Change Score Models},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Alexandria K.

Methods Behavioral data was collected across 99 sessions from 38 participants recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit. Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical ``clinical rounds'' encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Analysis We quantified aspects of participants' verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants' PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures. Results Our predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains. Conclusion Our interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis.\n@article{girard2022,\n  title = {Computational Analysis of Spoken Language in Acute Psychosis and Mania},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chance-corrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S-coefficient, Scott's pi, Fleiss' kappa, and Van Oest's uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott's pi and Fleiss' kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient often performs much better than the S-coefficient, but the S-coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement.

To assess whether the results are reproducible, it is good practice to let two or more raters independently classify the items, compute the proportion of pairwise rater agreement, and adjust for agreement expected by chance. Most chance-corrected agreement coefficients assume nominal categories and include only full agreements in which raters choose the same category. However, many situations (e.g., point scales) imply ordinal categories, where raters may receive partial credit for disagreements, based on the distance of their chosen categories and captured by a weighting scheme. Furthermore, raters often classify only subsets of items, where the missing data occur either by accident or by design. The present study develops a framework to estimate chance-corrected agreement for all four combinations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The resulting coefficient requires only a few lines of programming code and captures several existing coefficients via different values of its input parameters; it augments all nested coefficients with a weighting scheme and the option of missing item classifications. We use simulation to compare the coefficient performances for different weighting schemes, missing data mechanisms, and category proportions: The so-called uniform prior coefficient often (but not always) performs best. Furthermore, our framework implies that chance-corrected agreement coefficients, both unweighted and weighted, estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing.

Clients may terminate therapy for various reasons, but one of the most common causes is the lack of a strong working alliance. The concept of working alliance captures the collaborative relationship between a client and their therapist when working toward the progress and recovery of the client seeking treatment. Unfortunately, clients are often unwilling to directly express dissatisfaction in care until they have already decided to terminate therapy. On the other side, therapists may miss subtle signs of client discontent during treatment before it is too late. In this work, we demonstrate that nonverbal behavior analysis may aid in bridging this gap. The present study focuses primarily on the head gestures of both the client and therapist, contextualized within conversational turn-taking actions between the pair during psychotherapy sessions. We identify multiple behavior patterns suggestive of an individual's perspective on the working alliance; interestingly, these patterns also differ between the client and the therapist. These patterns inform the development of predictive models for self-reported ratings of working alliance, which demonstrate significant predictive power for both client and therapist ratings. Future applications of such models may stimulate preemptive intervention to strengthen a weak working alliance, whether explicitly attempting to repair the existing alliance or establishing a more suitable client-therapist pairing, to ensure that clients encounter fewer barriers to receiving the treatment they need.\n@inproceedings{vail2021,\n  title = {Goals, Tasks, and Bonds: Toward the Computational Assessment of Therapist versus Client Perception of Working Alliance},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Alexandria K.

One of the top research priorities has been to identify factors affecting perceptions of physical attractiveness (PPA). Recent work suggests PPA derives from different sources (e.g., target, perceiver, stimulus type). Although smiles in particular are believed to enhance PPA, support has been surprisingly limited. This study comprehensively examines the effect of smiles on PPA and, more broadly, evaluates the roles of target, perceiver, and stimulus type in PPA variation. Perceivers (n\\,=\\,181) rated both static images and 5-s videos of targets displaying smiling and neutral-expressions. Smiling images were rated as more attractive than neutral-expression images (regardless of stimulus motion format). Interestingly, perceptions of physical attractiveness were based more on the perceiver than on either the target or format in which the target was presented. Results clarify the effect of smiles, and highlight the significant role of the perceiver, in PPA.\n@article{bowdring2021,\n  title = {In the Eye of the Beholder: A Comprehensive Analysis of Stimulus Type, Perceiver, and Target in Physical Attractiveness Perceptions},\n  author = {Molly A.

The principal exemplar of this view is the Duchenne smile, a configuration of facial-muscle movements (i.e., smiling with eye constriction) that has been argued to reliably reveal genuine positive emotion. In this paper, we formalized a list of hypotheses that have been proposed regarding the Duchenne smile, briefly reviewed the literature weighing on these hypotheses, identified limitations and unanswered questions, and conducted two empirical studies to begin addressing these limitations and answering these questions. Both studies analyzed a database of 751 smiles observed while 136 participants completed experimental tasks designed to elicit amusement, embarrassment, fear, and physical pain. Study 1 focused on participants' self-reported positive emotion and Study 2 focused on how third-party observers would perceive videos of these smiles. Most of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the Duchenne smile were either contradicted by or only weakly supported by our data. Eye constriction did provide some information about experienced positive emotion, but this information was lacking in specificity, already provided by other smile characteristics, and highly dependent on context. Eye constriction provided more information about perceived positive emotion, including some unique information over other smile characteristics, but context was also important here as well. Overall, our results suggest that accurately inferring positive emotion from a smile requires more sophisticated methods than simply looking for the presence/absence (or even the intensity) of eye constriction.\n@article{girard2021,\n  title = {Reconsidering the {{Duchenne}} Smile: Formalizing and Testing Hypotheses about Eye Constriction and Positive Emotion},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

The subjective evaluation of artificial human-like behaviour in embodied conversational agents is however expensive and little is known about the quality of the data it returns. Two approaches to subjective evaluation can be largely distinguished, one relying on ratings, the other on pairwise comparisons. In this study we use co-speech gestures to compare the two against each other and answer questions about their appropriateness for evaluation of artificial behaviour. We consider their ability to rate quality, but also aspects pertaining to the effort of use and the time required to collect subjective data. We use crowd sourcing to rate the quality of co-speech gestures in avatars, assessing which method picks up more detail in subjective assessments. We compared gestures generated by three different machine learning models with various level of behavioural quality. We found that both approaches were able to rank the videos according to quality and that the ranking significantly correlated, showing that in terms of quality there is no preference of one method over the other. We also found that pairwise comparisons were slightly faster and came with improved inter-rater reliability, suggesting that for small-scale studies pairwise comparisons are to be favoured over ratings.\n@inproceedings{wolfert2021,\n  title = {To Rate or Not to Rate: Investigating Evaluation Methods for Generated Co-Speech Gestures},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Pieter Wolfert and Jeffrey M.

Much less studied, however, is expressiveness---the extent to which someone shows any feeling or emotion. Expressiveness is related to personality and mental health and plays a crucial role in social interaction. As such, the ability to automatically detect or predict expressiveness can facilitate significant advancements in areas ranging from psychiatric care to artificial social intelligence. Motivated by these potential applications, we present an extension of the BP4D+ dataset (Zhang et al. 2016) with human ratings of expressiveness and develop methods for (1) automatically predicting expressiveness from visual data and (2) defining relationships between interpretable visual signals and expressiveness. In addition, we study the emotional context in which expressiveness occurs and hypothesize that different sets of signals are indicative of expressiveness in different contexts (e.g., in response to surprise or in response to pain). Analysis of our statistical models confirms our hypothesis. Consequently, by looking at expressiveness separately in distinct emotional contexts, our predictive models show significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to human performance in terms of correlation with the ground truth.\n@inproceedings{lin2020a,\n  title = {Context-Dependent Models for Predicting and Characterizing Facial Expressiveness},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd {{Workshop}} on {{Affective Content Analysis}} Co-Located with the 34th {{AAAI Conference}} on {{Artificial Intelligence}}},\n  author = {Victoria Lin and Jeffrey M.

Due to the close relationship between emotional expressiveness and behavioral health, as well as the crucial role that it plays in social interaction, the ability to automatically predict emotional expressiveness stands to spur advances in science, medicine, and industry. In this paper, we explore three related research questions. First, how well can emotional expressiveness be predicted from visual, linguistic, and multimodal behavioral signals? Second, how important is each behavioral modality to the prediction of emotional expressiveness? Third, which behavioral signals are reliably related to emotional expressiveness? To answer these questions, we add highly reliable transcripts and human ratings of perceived emotional expressiveness to an existing video database and use this data to train, validate, and test predictive models. Our best model shows promising predictive performance on this dataset ({\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend} = 0.65, {\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}2 = 0.45, {\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend} = 0.74). Multimodal models tend to perform best overall, and models trained on the linguistic modality tend to outperform models trained on the visual modality. Finally, examination of our interpretable models' coefficients reveals a number of visual and linguistic behavioral signals---such as facial action unit intensity, overall word count, and use of words related to social processes---that reliably predict emotional expressiveness.\n@inproceedings{lin2020,\n  title = {Toward Multimodal Modeling of Emotional Expressiveness},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 22nd {{International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Victoria Lin and Jeffrey M.

This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to quantify in vivo daily patterns of social interaction in adults as a function of demographic and clinical factors. Method Adults with and without ASD (NASD\\,=\\,23, NNeurotypical\\,=\\,52) were trained in an EMA protocol to report their social interactions via smartphone over one week. Participants completed measures of IQ, ASD symptom severity and alexithymia symptom severity. Results Cyclical multilevel models were used to account for nesting of observations. Results suggest a daily cyclical pattern of social interaction that was robust to ASD and alexithymia symptoms. Adults with ASD did not have fewer social interactions than neurotypical peers; however, severity of alexithymia symptoms predicted fewer social interactions regardless of ASD status. Conclusions These findings suggest that alexithymia, not ASD severity, may drive social isolation and highlight the need to reevaluate previously accepted notions regarding differences in social behavior utilizing modern methods.\n@article{gerber2019,\n  title = {Alexithymia -- Not Autism -- Is Associated with Frequency of Social Interactions in Adults},\n  author = {Alan H.

Participants included 450 adolescents aged 12--14 years in the southern United States. Regression analyses showed favorable attitudes toward sexual behavior and social norms significantly predicted recent sexual behavior, and favorable attitudes toward condoms significantly predicted condom usage. Self-efficacy was not found to be predictive of adolescents' sexual behavior or condom use. There were no significant differences in recent sexual behavior based on type of sexuality education. Adolescents who received abstinence-only education had reduced favorable attitudes toward condom use, and were more likely to have unprotected sex than the comparison group. Findings suggest that adolescents who receive abstinence-only education are at greater risk of engaging in unprotected sex.\n@article{shepherd2017,\n  title = {Comparison of Comprehensive and Abstinence-Only Sexuality Education in Young African American Adolescents},\n  author = {Lindsay M.

However, despite progress in new approaches as well as benchmarking efforts, most evaluations still focus on either posed expressions, near-frontal recordings, or both. This makes it hard to tell how existing expression recognition approaches perform under conditions where faces appear in a wide range of poses (or camera views), displaying ecologically valid expressions. The main obstacle for assessing this is the availability of suitable data, and the challenge proposed here addresses this limitation. The FG 2017 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017) extends FERA 2015 to the estimation of Action Units occurrence and intensity under different camera views. In this paper we present the third challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2017, in Washington, United States. Two sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, and the estimation of AU intensity. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for both sub-challenges.\n@inproceedings{valstar2017,\n  title = {{{FERA}} 2017 - Addressing Head Pose in the Third Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis Challenge},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 12th {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Michel F Valstar and Enrique Sanchez-Lozano and Jeffrey F.

Facial behavior is a valuable source of informationabout an individual's feelings and intentions. However, manyfactors combine to influence and moderate facial behaviorincluding personality, gender, context, and culture. Due to thehigh cost of traditional observational methods, the relationshipbetween culture and facial behavior is not well-understood. Inthe current study, we explored the sociocultural factors that influencefacial behavior using large-scale observational analyses.We developed and implemented an algorithm to automaticallyanalyze the smiling of 866,726 participants across 31 differentcountries. We found that participants smiled more when from acountry that is higher in individualism, has a lower populationdensity, and has a long history of immigration diversity (i.e.,historical heterogeneity). Our findings provide the first evidencethat historical heterogeneity predicts actual smiling behavior.Furthermore, they converge with previous findings using selfreportmethods. Taken together, these findings support thetheory that historical heterogeneity explains, and may evencontribute to the development of, permissive cultural displayrules that encourage the open expression of emotion.\n@inproceedings{girard2017a,\n  title = {Historical Heterogeneity Predicts Smiling: Evidence from Large-Scale Observational Analyses},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 12th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

However, observational studies of actual patterns of facial behavior have been rare and typically limited to the analysis of dozens of participants from two or three regions. We present the first large-scale evidence of cultural differences in observed facial behavior, including 740,984 participants from 12 countries around the world. We used an Internet-based framework to collect video data of participants in two different settings: in their homes and in market research facilities. Using computer vision algorithms designed for this data set, we measured smiling and brow furrowing expressions as participants watched television ads. Our results reveal novel findings and provide empirical evidence to support theories about cultural and gender differences in display rules. Participants from more individualist cultures displayed more brow furrowing overall, whereas smiling depended on both culture and setting. Specifically, participants from more individualist countries were more expressive in the facility setting, while participants from more collectivist countries were more expressive in the home setting. Female participants displayed more smiling and less brow furrowing than male participants overall, with the latter difference being more pronounced in more individualist countries. This is the first study to leverage advances in computer science to enable large-scale observational research that would not have been possible using traditional methods\n@article{mcduff2017,\n  title = {Large-Scale Observational Evidence of Cross-Cultural Differences in Facial Behavior},\n  author = {Daniel McDuff and Jeffrey M.

Full understanding of behavior and experience requires anappreciation of time-dependent patterns. However, traditionalmethods of observational measurement and self-reportingare ill-suited to capturing such patterns. These methodstend to polarize into either macro-level (gist) analyses oflarge swaths of time or micro-level (atomic) analyses ofdiscrete segments.

The current article provides an interdisciplinary primer on observational measurement; in particular, it highlights recent advances in observational methodology and the challenges that accompany such growth. First, we detail the various types of instrument that can be used to standardize measurements across observers. Second, we argue for the importance of validity in observational measurement and provide several approaches to validation based on contemporary validity theory. Third, we outline the challenges currently faced by observational researchers pertaining to measurement drift, observer reactivity, reliability analysis, and time/expense. Fourth, we describe recent advances in computer-assisted measurement, fully automated measurement, and statistical data analysis. Finally, we identify several key directions for future observational research to explore.\n@article{girard2016a,\n  title = {A Primer on Observational Measurement},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

New computational approaches make possible automated audiovisual measurement of behaviors that humans struggle to quantify (e.g., movement velocity and voice inflection). These tools have the potential to improve screening and diagnosis, identify new behavioral indicators of depression, measure response to clinical intervention, and test clinical theories about underlying mechanisms. Highlights include a study that measured the temporal coordination of vocal tract and facial movements, a study that predicted which adolescents would go on to develop depression based on their voice qualities, and a study that tested the behavioral predictions of clinical theories using automated measures of facial actions and head motion.\n@article{girard2015c,\n  title = {Automated Audiovisual Depression Analysis},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

All rights reserved. Both the occurrence and intensity of facial expressions are critical to what the face reveals. While much progress has been made toward the automatic detection of facial expression occurrence, controversy exists about how to estimate expression intensity. The most straight-forward approach is to train multiclass or regression models using intensity ground truth. However, collecting intensity ground truth is even more time consuming and expensive than collecting binary ground truth. As a shortcut, some researchers have proposed using the decision values of binary-trained maximum margin classifiers as a proxy for expression intensity. We provide empirical evidence that this heuristic is flawed in practice as well as in theory. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts when it comes to estimating smile intensity: researchers must take the time to collect and train on intensity ground truth. However, if they do so, high reliability with expert human coders can be achieved. Intensity-trained multiclass and regression models outperformed binary-trained classifier decision values on smile intensity estimation across multiple databases and methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Multiclass models even outperformed binary-trained classifiers on smile occurrence detection.\n@article{girard2015b,\n  title = {Estimating Smile Intensity: A Better Way},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

One of the challenges that is actively being addressed is the automatic estimation of expression intensities. To continue to provide a standardisation platform and to help the field progress beyond its current limitations, the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015) will challenge participants to estimate FACS Action Unit (AU) intensity as well as AU occurrence on a common benchmark dataset with reliable manual annotations. Evaluation will be done using a clear and well-defined protocol. In this paper we present the second such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 11 IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2015, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Three sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, the estimation of AU intensity for pre-segmented data, and fully automatic AU intensity estimation. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for the three sub-challenges.\n@inproceedings{valstar2015,\n  title = {{{FERA}} 2015 - Second Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis Challenge},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Michel F.

Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka ``spontaneous'') facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing,well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required.We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this newdatabase is the first of its kind for the public. Thework promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action.\n@article{zhang2014,\n  title = {{{BP4D-spontaneous}}: A High-Resolution Spontaneous {{3D}} Dynamic Facial Expression Database},\n  author = {Xing Zhang and Lijun Yin and Jeffrey F.

It is designed to be highly user-friendly and easily customizable. Based on Gottman and Levenson's affect rating dial, CARMA enables researchers and study participants to provide moment-by-moment ratings of multimedia files using a computer mouse or keyboard. The rating scale can be configured on a number of parameters including the labels for its upper and lower bounds, its numerical range, and its visual representation. Annotations can be displayed alongside the multimedia file and saved for easy import into statistical analysis software. CARMA provides a tool for researchers in affective computing, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences who need to capture the unfolding of subjective experience and observable behavior over time.\n@article{girard2014b,\n  title = {{{CARMA}}: Software for Continuous Affect Rating and Media Annotation},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for FACS action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science.\n@article{girard2014,\n  title = {Nonverbal Social Withdrawal in Depression: {{Evidence}} from Manual and Automatic Analyses},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Across multiple channels, nonverbal behavior communicates information about affective states and interpersonal intentions. Researchers interested in understanding how these nonverbal messages are transmitted and interpreted have examined the relationship between behavior and ratings of interpersonal motives using dimensions such as agency and communion. However, previous work has focused on images of posed behavior and it is unclear how well these results will generalize to more dynamic representations of real-world behavior. The current study proposes to extend the current literature by examining how gender, facial expression intensity, and head pose influence interpersonal ratings in videos of spontaneous nonverbal behavior.\n@inproceedings{girard2014a,\n  title = {Perceptions of Interpersonal Behavior Are Influenced by Gender, Facial Expression Intensity, and Head Pose},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2014 {{International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Yet, the meaning and function of facial actions often depends in part on their intensity. We propose a part-based, sparse representation for automated measurement of continuous variation in AU intensity. We evaluated its effectiveness in two publically available databases, CK+ and the soon to be released Binghamton high-resolution spontaneous 3D dyadic facial expression database. The former consists of posed facial expressions and ordinal level intensity (absent, low, and high). The latter consists of spontaneous facial expression in response to diverse, well-validated emotion inductions, and 6 ordinal levels of AU intensity. In a preliminary test, we started from discrete emotion labels and ordinal-scale intensity annotation in the CK+ dataset. The algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. These preliminary results supported the utility of the part-based, sparse representation. Second, we applied the algorithm to the more demanding task of continuous AU intensity estimation in spontaneous facial behavior in the Binghamton database. Manual 6-point ordinal coding and continuous measurement were highly consistent. Visual analysis of the overlay of continuous measurement by the algorithm and manual ordinal coding strongly supported the representational power of the proposed method to smoothly interpolate across the full range of AU intensity.\n@inproceedings{jeni2013,\n  title = {Continuous {{AU}} Intensity Estimation Using Localized, Sparse Facial Feature Space},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 10th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automated Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {L{\\a'a}szl{\\a'o} A Jeni and Jeffrey M.

Facial expressions were analyzed from the video using both manual and automatic systems. Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units, and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. For both systems, when symptom severity was high, participants made more facial expressions associated with contempt, smiled less, and those smiles that occurred were more likely to be accompanied by facial actions associated with contempt. These results are consistent with the ``social risk hypothesis'' of depression. According to this hypothesis, when symptoms are severe, depressed participants withdraw from other people in order to protect themselves from anticipated rejection, scorn, and social exclusion. As their symptoms fade, participants send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate.

However, there are many potential ways to select a threshold. How do different criteria and metrics compare? Manually FACS coded video of 45 clinical interviews (Spectrum dataset) were processed using person-specific active appearance models (AAM). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained using an independent dataset (RU-FACS). Spectrum sessions were randomly assigned to training (n=32) and testing sets (n=13). Six different threshold selection criteria were compared for automatic A U coding. Three major findings emerged: 1) Thresholds that attempt to balance the confusion matrix (using kappa, F1, or MCC) performed significantly better on all metrics than thresholds that select arbitrary error or accuracy rates (such as TPR, FPR, or EER). 2) AU detection scores for kappa, F1, and MCC were highly intercorrelated; accuracy was uncorrelated with the others. And 3) Kappa, MCC, and Fl were all positively correlated with base rate. They increased with increases in AU base rates. Accuracy, by contrast, showed the opposite pattern. It was strongly negatively correlated with base rate. These findings suggest that better automatic coding can be obtained by using threshold-selection criteria that balance the confusion matrix and benefit from increased AU base rates in the training data.\n@inproceedings{girard2011,\n  title = {Criteria and Metrics for Thresholded {{AU}} Detection},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Computer Vision Workshops}} ({{ICCV Workshops}})},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn a previous blog post on AI Transcription, I discussed the performance benefits of moving to WSL2 for CUDA support on Windows. However, the process of setting up and using the virtual machine was very technical, which may be a barrier for many users. In this blog post, I will discuss the use of a technology called Docker to ease the setup and use of WSL2.\nDocker is a tool that makes it easy to package and run applications in a “container,” which is a lightweight, standalone environment that includes everything an application needs to run. This way, the application will work the same way on any computer without worrying about setup or compatibility issues.\nThere are three main components to Docker: a Dockerfile, a Docker image, and a Docker container. To explain these, I will use a pizza analogy. Just like a chef might create a recipe that contains step-by-step instructions for preparing a pizza, a power user might create a Dockerfile that contains detailed and reproducible instructions for building and configuring a software environment. This recipe might then be followed in a food processing plant to produce many identical pizzas, which are then frozen for re-sale. Similarly, the Dockerfile instructions might be followed to “build” a Docker image, which contains all the resulting files and settings. Finally, a customer might purchase a frozen pizza, bring it home, and reheat it in their own oven for consumption. In much the same way, a user might download or “pull” a Docker image from the internet and “run” it as a Docker container on their own computer to use the desired application. The benefit of this approach is that the customer/user doesn’t need to understand or even know about the recipe/Dockerfile instructions to enjoy the pizza/container!\nI have played the role of chef or power user here and condensed the instructions from my previous blog post into a Dockerfile and built it into a Docker image that you can easily pull and run.\nBefore we dive into things, I’ll provide a brief overview of all the steps.\n\nCheck that our computer’s hardware supports CUDA\nInstall/update the NVIDIA graphics driver on Windows\nInstall Docker Desktop on Windows\nPull the preconfigured Docker image\nRun the Docker image with GPU support\nLog into RStudio Server and use audio.whisper"

    "text": "Check for CUDA Support\nThis post assumes that you are using the Windows operating system and that your computer’s graphics card supports CUDA. To check that this is the case, first look up your graphics card’s model number. An easy way to do this on Windows 10/11 is to click on the desktop search bar (bottom-left of the screen next to the windows icon) and type in “Device Manager.” Then click the arrow next to “Display adapters” and find your graphics card’s model name. On my computer, it says “NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060.” Then go to this link and click the “CUDA-Enabled NVIDIA Quadro and NVIDIA RTX” and “CUDA-Enabled GeForce and TITAN Products” blocks to open their accordions. Then search for your graphics card’s model number (the left tables are for desktop cards and the right tables are for notebook cards). I found “GeForce RTX 2060” on the list under GeForce and TITAN Products with a compute capability of 7.5. Thus, my card is supported!"

To study verbal behavior, it is often necessary to generate transcripts, which are written records of the words that were spoken.

I will first show you how to quickly install the audio.whisper R package and transcribe an example file. However, the processing will be very slow and we can do much, much better if we offload some of the work to a dedicated graphics card, such as an Nvidia card with CUDA.

Earlier entries on that list are smaller (to download and hold in RAM), faster, and less accurate whereas later entries are larger, slower, and more accurate. There are also English-only versions of all but the large model, which end in \".en\" as in \"base.en\", and these may be more efficient if you know that all speech will be in English. You can learn more about these models via ?whisper_download_model. For this tutorial, we will go with the \"base\" model.\n\n# Load package from library\nlibrary(audio.whisper)\n\n\n# Download or load from file the desired whisper model\nmodel &lt;- whisper(\"base\")\n## whisper_init_from_file_with_params_no_state: loading model from 'C:/GitHub/affcomlab/posts/whisper2024/ggml-base.bin'\n## whisper_model_load: loading model\n## whisper_model_load: n_vocab       = 51865\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_ctx   = 1500\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_state = 512\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_head  = 8\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_layer = 6\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_ctx    = 448\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_state  = 512\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_head   = 8\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_layer  = 6\n## whisper_model_load: n_mels        = 80\n## whisper_model_load: ftype         = 1\n## whisper_model_load: qntvr         = 0\n## whisper_model_load: type          = 2 (base)\n## whisper_model_load: adding 1608 extra tokens\n## whisper_model_load: n_langs       = 99\n## whisper_model_load:      CPU buffer size =   147.46 MB\n## whisper_model_load: model size    =  147.37 MB\n## whisper_init_state: kv self size  =   16.52 MB\n## whisper_init_state: kv cross size =   18.43 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (conv)   =   14.86 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (encode) =   85.99 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (cross)  =    4.78 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (decode) =   96.48 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the larger models may take a while to download, so if you get an error that the download took longer than permitted, you can temporarily allow more time via: options(timeout = 300).\n\n\n\n\nTranscribe example file\nThe package comes with an example audio file in the proper format, which contains 11 seconds of a speech by John F. Kennedy Jr. Let’s load it from file using system.file() and then transcribe it using predict().\n\n# Construct file path to example audio file in package data\njfk &lt;- system.file(package = \"audio.whisper\", \"samples\", \"jfk.wav\")\n\n# Run English transcription using the downloaded whisper model\nout &lt;- predict(model, newdata = jfk, language = \"en\")\n\n# Print transcript\nout$data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsegment\nsegment_offset\nfrom\nto\ntext\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n00:00:00.000\n00:00:11.000\nAnd so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results look good! But we can see how long this took by digging into the output object.\n\n# Examine the time elapsed to process this audio\nout$timing\n## $transcription_start\n## [1] \"2024-08-15 12:30:48 CDT\"\n## \n## $transcription_end\n## [1] \"2024-08-15 12:51:48 CDT\"\n## \n## $transcription_duration\n## Time difference of 20.98786 mins\n\nYikes, 21 minutes to process just 11 seconds of audio. That’s motivation to work on the CUDA version to speed things up. But before we move on to that, I’ll first show you how to extract audio from a video file and convert it to the format that Whisper wants.\n\n\nExtract and format audio\nDownload the example mlk.mp4 video file, which contains 12 seconds of a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. This video contains an audio stream in AAC format with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. However, whisper requires audio files in WAV format with a sampling rate of 16 kHz. We can extract and convert it in one step using the av_audio_convert() function from the av package.\n\n# Install av package if you don't have it already\n# install.packages(\"av\")\n\n# Load package from library\nlibrary(av)\n\n# Extract and convert audio\nav_audio_convert(\n  \"mlk.mp4\", \n  output = \"mlk.wav\", \n  format = \"wav\", \n  sample_rate = 16000\n)\n## [1] \"C:\\\\GitHub\\\\affcomlab\\\\posts\\\\whisper2024\\\\mlk.wav\"\n\nNote that the process would have been identical if this had been an audio file in a different format rather than a video file - you would just replace the .mp4 file with the audio file (e.g., .mp3). Now let’s transcribe this and verify that our conversion worked.\n\n# Run English transcription using the downloaded whisper model\nout2 &lt;- predict(model, newdata = \"mlk.wav\", language = \"en\")\n\n# Print transcript\nout2$data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsegment\nsegment_offset\nfrom\nto\ntext\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n00:00:00.000\n00:00:02.000\nI have a dream.\n\n\n2\n0\n00:00:02.000\n00:00:12.000\nBut one day, this nation will rise up, live up the true meaning of its creed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot perfect (swapped “that” for “but” and omitted an “and”) but pretty good. And this only the base model - it might do better with a larger model, but for time’s sake I’ll leave that until after we get CUDA working in Part 2.\n\nContinue to Part 2  »"

Instead, if you are just learning {dplyr}, you would probably try to combine the mean() and mutate() functions as below.\n\n# Example 1 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c(x1, x2, x3)))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  10.8\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4  10.8\n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9  10.8\n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8  10.8\n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  10.8\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  10.8\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  10.8\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  10.8\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9  10.8\n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4  10.8\n\n\nHowever, you’ll notice in the output above that the new xmean variable contains repetitions of a constant value. What is going on here? Basically, what mutate() did was take all the numbers in x1, x2, and x3, combine them into one long vector of 30 numbers, and send that vector to the mean() function. The mean() function then returns a single value—the mean of all 30 numbers—and tries to put that into the new column xmean. But because the column needs to be a vector of 10 numbers to fit into the tibble, that single value gets recycled (i.e., repeated 10 times). To verify this is what happened, we can do the operation by hand and see that we get the same number:\n\nmean(c(x1, x2, x3))\n\n[1] 10.79233\n\n\nSo, clearly mutate() is not doing what we intended it to do."

The simplest version simply adds a call to the rowwise() function to our pipeline before the mutate().\n\n# Example 2 (works but slow)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt;  \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c(x1, x2, x3)))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n# Rowwise: \n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  8.28\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4 11.0 \n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9 12.9 \n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8 11.0 \n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  7.25\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  3.34\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  8.95\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  9.16\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9 17.0 \n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4 19.1 \n\n\nThis did what we wanted it to do, despite the actual mutate() call being identical to what is was before! Pretty cool. We can even save some time by selecting the variables to include in the mean() operation automatically, instead of listing them out in the c() function. This isn’t such a time-savings in this case with only three variables, but in settings with more variables it can really add up. To do so, we just need to use a tidy selection function; in this case, all the variables we want to include start with the letter “x” so let’s use starts_with().\n\n# Example 3 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise()|&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(starts_with(\"x\")))\n\nError in `mutate()`:\nℹ In argument: `xmean = mean(starts_with(\"x\"))`.\nℹ In row 1.\nCaused by error:\n! `starts_with()` must be used within a *selecting* function.\nℹ See &lt;https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-selection-context.html&gt; for\n  details.\n\n\nShoot, that didn’t work. But why not? Basically, the problem is that mutate() doesn’t know what do to with selection functions like starts_with(). The error message basically says that we are in the “wrong context” for a selection function."

    "section": "Remember to ungroup()",
    "text": "Remember to ungroup()\nThere are two things to note about rowwise(), however. First, it transformed our tibble into an implicitly “grouped” tibble, which is what allowed our mutate() function to calculate row-wise means instead of overall means (basically, it is treating each row as a separate group and calculating the means per group/row). However, after that mutate() call, the tibble remains grouped. This is handy if we want to continue doing row-wise operations, but how do we tell it to stop once we are done with row-wise operations and want to return to “normal” behavior? Let’s see when this could be a problem; one example is if we want to calculate the maximum row-wise mean xmean_max.\n\n# Example 5 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c_across(starts_with(\"x\")))) |&gt; \n  summarize(xmean_max = max(xmean))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n   xmean_max\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      8.28\n 2     11.0 \n 3     12.9 \n 4     11.0 \n 5      7.25\n 6      3.34\n 7      8.95\n 8      9.16\n 9     17.0 \n10     19.1 \n\n\nHere we wanted to summarize over all values of xmean and expected a single maximum value. Instead we got the same 10 values back. What happened? Basically, our tibble was still implicitly grouped by row and the summarize() function respected that, calculating the maximum of each group/row. To avoid this behavior, we can add the ungroup() function to our pipeline (reverting the tibble back to a standard one without implicit grouping).\n\n# Example 6 (works but slow)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c_across(starts_with(\"x\")))) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  summarize(xmean_max = max(xmean))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  xmean_max\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      19.1\n\n\nNow we get the desired behavior, and so I am usually very careful to add ungroup() to my pipeline as soon as I am done with row-wise operations (otherwise you might end up with some unexpected problems)."

    "text": "Faster means with rowMeans()\nThe other thing to note about rowwise() is that it can be slow. With a small tibble like this, it doesn’t matter much, but the difference could be meaningful for larger and more complex data. In these cases, you have some alternatives. This blog post describes some of them, but does not address the specific case of means, which is what I want to do the most in practice. A faster alternative in this case is to use the rowMeans() function. As you might imagine, this function takes in a numeric matrix or dataframe and returns the mean of each row.\n\nrowMeans(n10)\n\n [1] 30.89482 29.57077 27.64172 32.52192 28.06156 31.59763 28.28442 35.62799\n [9] 36.23378 37.56994\n\n\nBut we want to exclude the y variable and append it to the n10 tibble. How can we do so? We might reasonably try to put it into mutate() like we did with mean():\n\n# Example 7 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = rowMeans(c(x1, x2, x3)))\n\nError in `mutate()`:\nℹ In argument: `xmean = rowMeans(c(x1, x2, x3))`.\nCaused by error in `rowMeans()`:\n! 'x' must be an array of at least two dimensions\n\n\nBut here we run into a problem. rowMeans() is expecting a numeric matrix or data frame, but is being provided with a vector of 30 numbers again (as in Example 1). Thus, it doesn’t have rows to calculate means within and returns an error. We can solve this by transforming the vector to a matrix:\n\n# Example 8 (works but inconvenient)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = rowMeans(matrix(c(x1, x2, x3), ncol = 3)))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  8.28\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4 11.0 \n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9 12.9 \n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8 11.0 \n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  7.25\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  3.34\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  8.95\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  9.16\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9 17.0 \n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4 19.1 \n\n\nBut this is inconvenient and error prone. Luckily, dplyr 1.1.0 added a way to streamline this kind of thing. We can use the new pick() function to create this context. Note that we are using pick() here instead of c_across() because the latter is for working within rows (in combination with rowwise()) and here we want the row-wise operations to be handled by rowMeans().\n\n# Example 9 (works and convenient and fast)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = rowMeans(pick(starts_with(\"x\"))))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  8.28\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4 11.0 \n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9 12.9 \n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8 11.0 \n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  7.25\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  3.34\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  8.95\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  9.16\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9 17.0 \n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4 19.1 \n\n\nTo test the speed of each approach, we can use the microbenchmark package, which will precisely time each approach over multiple iterations (in this case, 100).

So, although I think it is worth learning the new rowwise() and c_across() functions, in settings where observations are many and speed in paramount, it may be worthwhile to learn “parallel” functions such as rowMeans(), rowSums(), pmin(), pmax(), and paste()."

    "text": "Are you accepting applications for new graduate students?\nYes! I am planning to review applications for graduate students to start in Fall 2023 and may admit one or two Psychology PhD students across the Clinical Psychological Science (CPS) and Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) programs. The application deadline for both programs is December 1, 2022.\n\n\nWhat does your lab study?\nThe AffCom lab develops and uses technology to advance scientific understanding of how emotional, social, and mental health-related information is communicated through verbal and nonverbal behavior. Our work is eclectic and spans basic science on emotion and behavior; clinical science on assessment and treatment; and methodological science on the collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of research data.\n\n\nWhat are your research plans for the near future?\nIn the next few years, I plan to study (1) how therapists and patients with depression communicate during psychotherapy sessions, (2) how individuals with and without a history of trauma communicate their experiences and construct narratives, (3) how psychotic symptoms affect the production of communicative behavior, and (4) how technology can be used to more precisely measure emotional expressiveness in both healthy and clinical populations. I am also planning to work on software related to inter-rater agreement, hierarchical latent variable modeling, and web-based video annotation. See the research page for more information.\n\n\nShould I apply to work with you at KU?\nI welcome applications from all qualified students regardless of background. However, admissions are competitive, and applications are not free; thus, I want to give applicants a better idea of what I am looking for so that they can make an informed decision about whether to invest their time and money.\nFirst, note that I currently only advise PhD students in the CPS and BBQ programs. The psychology department does not offer a terminal Masters degree and I am not affiliated with the Child Clinical Psychology program. Second, note that my lab does not specialize in neuroscience or do much brain-focused research (i.e., we skew more towards the behavior and quantitative side of the BBQ program).\nThe primary criteria I use to evaluate applications are (1) evidence of the applicant’s ability to succeed in a research-focused PhD program, (2) a match between the applicant’s academic interests/experiences and my own areas of interest/expertise, and (3) a match between the applicant’s interpersonal style and my own.\nTo be competitive for admission, applicants should have (1) a strong academic record with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in psychology or a related field, (2) previous experience working/volunteering in one or more research labs, (3) a high level of maturity and professionalism conducive to collaborative and/or clinical work, and (4) a direct connection to my area of research such as through previous coursework, research experience, or independent study.\n\n\nWhat is the funding situation for graduate students?\nI would not take on a graduate student if I did not believe that I could provide them full funding (tuition remission, stipend, and benefits) for four to five years. Funding comes primarily from teaching assistantships, although research assistantships and scholarships are also possibilities. Supplemental summer funding is also often possible depending on our success in securing research grants.\n\n\nWhat is your stance on scientific reform?\nI am committed to making my science more transparent, open, reproducible, and accountable though the (1) sharing of research preprints, materials, and data, (2) transparent description of hypotheses and methods, and (3) use and development of free and open-source software.\n\n\nCan potential applicants meet with you before applying?\nDue to the high number of inquiries I receive each year, it is unfortunately not possible for me to meet with potential applicants. However, I will carefully review every application that lists my name and those applicants who are invited to interview will have the opportunity to speak with me one-on-one.\n\n\nCan potential applicants speak to students in the lab?\nSimilar to the question above, applicants who are invited to interview will have the opportunity to speak to graduate students and research assistants in the lab (as well as various other members of the department).\n\n\nHow do I apply?\nAdmission information and links can be found on the Psychology Graduate Program webpage. Scroll down and open the “Admission” accordion or click on one of the “Application Instructions” links. You will need to submit a curriculum vitae, statement of purpose, three letters of recommendations, and transcripts."

He then completed his predoctoral clinical internship at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (inpatient psychiatry, trauma treatment, neuropsychology) and a two-year postdoctoral research fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University under the mentorship of Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (verbal behavior, machine learning, computer science).\nHe is now an Associate Professor in the department of Psychology at the University of Kansas, where he directs the Affective Communication and Computing lab and the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) program. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on psychological assessment, data science, and statistics within the department and is a co-founder of SMaRT Workshops, which offers numerous methodological training workshops to faculty and students.

Many enroll in PSYC 480 and receive credit hours for this work. Research assistants attend weekly lab meetings and can expect a letter of recommendation from Dr. Girard describing their work in and contributions to the lab (please give one month of advanced notice). Opportunities to earn co-authorship on research products (e.g., conference presentations) are also occasionally offered to advanced research assistants.\nHonors students will also occasionally design and complete an independent research project (i.e., honors thesis) under the supervision of Dr. Girard over the course of their senior year. These students typically apply for (and have often won) research awards from the Center for Undergraduate Research and make oral or poster presentations about their work at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.\nApply to be a Research Assistant"

    "section": "Project Summary",
    "text": "Project Summary\nWhich psychiatric symptoms and behaviors are the most important to assess and manage during critical points in psychiatric healthcare, such as the time leading up to hospital discharge? At present, psychiatry lacks objective tests that could inform this and other clinically challenging–and potentially costly–decisions. Establishing valid objective markers of psychiatric disease processes is especially challenging compared with the development of biomarkers in other fields. One key challenge is lack of available data from psychiatrically ill patients during key periods in their care trajectory, which the present project seeks to address. A second major challenge, also addressed as a core feature in this project, is the complex, context-dependence of human behavioral expression, which greatly complicates efforts to establish robust, objective measures that reflect underlying mental health disease processes. This project will address both barriers, introducing a new computational framework, named Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics, to identify and evaluate behavioral biomarkers related to discharge-readiness and symptoms in severe mental illness. The project aims to address five fundamental research challenges: (1) Acquire a multimodal psychiatric discharge-planning dataset of 400 inpatients with severe mental illness; (2) Create self-aware linear and neural models to identify multimodal behavioral biomarkers; (3) Develop context-sensitive linear and neural models to contextualize behavioral biomarkers and quantify the influence of context on behavior; (4) Build a new adaptive assessment planning framework which creates a personalized patient analysis to rank contexts and modalities for the next assessment session; (5) Assess the trustworthiness and generalizability of our measurements, models, and insights. This research will improve basic understanding of social context and behavioral biomarkers, build objective measures for mental health assessment, and more broadly, pave the way for a restructured care-delivery system in which resources are allocated intelligently to ensure assessments are informative with respect to desired clinical objectives."

This project will: (1) deepen our understanding of the trajectory leading to hospitalization discharge with knowledge about behavioral biomarkers and their relationship to symptoms and discharge-readiness; (2) contribute to the knowledge on how social context impacts patient’s behaviors since some symptoms or predictive biomarkers may only be seen in a specific context such as social or solitary interactions; and (3) contribute a credible, objective framework for behavioral measurement by defining interpretable biomarkers and latent factors for symptoms and discharge assessment. The project will also enable a judicious use of remote sensing and non-direct clinical encounters (e.g., telemedicine), which are increasingly viewed as essential capabilities in the medical fields to reduce costs while maintaining or elevating care standards."

    "text": "Project Summary\nSuicide continues to be a growing public health concern. Indeed, suicide rates have increased 33% since 1999. This concern has been particularly pronounced in the case of adolescents, as the suicide rates in this age group have tripled over the last 10 years. Clarifying potential processes of risk for suicidal behavior in this population therefore remains a pressing priority. Increasing theoretical and empirical focus has been devoted to the conceptualization of acute suicidal risk as being a period of elevated arousal. Stress within parent-child relationship dynamics may hold particular importance for understanding adolescents’ proximal risk for suicidal behavior. However, all past studies examining parent-child relationship stress and suicidal behavior have used self-report methodologies and/or retrospective recall. Although studies employing these methodologies provide important knowledge about the association between life stress and mental health outcomes, they are not designed to characterize the interpersonal dynamics of these stressors as they unfold over time, which may be particularly relevant to short-term suicide risk. Recent advances in computational approaches to automatic sensing of acoustic and visual behaviors hold promise to address the need for clarifying indices of arousal in parent-child dynamics associated with adolescent suicide risk. A novel method to assess familial stress processes is through the automated assessment of synchrony, or the behavioral matching, of arousal between adolescents and their parents. In healthy parent-child dyads, parents and adolescents are responsive to each other’s behavioral and emotional cues. However, during high stress or conflict, behavioral matching may be a marker of a high-risk interaction pattern inasmuch as it may be indicative of high arousal maintenance or escalation. Focusing on the RDoC constructs of arousal and social processes, the current R21 proposal aims to leverage recent developments in automated sensing of acoustic and visual behavior to characterize synchrony within the dynamics of a parent-child conflict task in a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents (n = 100) and their parents. The current study aims to evaluate whether acoustic and visual behavioral markers of arousal synchrony, respectively, are associated with prospective suicidal ideation three months post-discharge. We also aim to pool acoustic and visual behavioral markers of parent-child arousal synchrony through computational modeling to create a multimodal prediction model for prospective suicidal ideation, thereby to advance beyond unimodal analysis to multimodal analysis in classifying suicide risk. This R21 is intended as an initial step toward automating the assessment of parent-child arousal synchrony within clinical contexts to inform clinical decision-making and interventions. This proposal has both scientific and clinical significance because it is the first study to employ computational automation of acoustic and visual markers of suicide risk at the dyadic level and has the potential directly to inform adolescent suicide risk assessment and intervention."

On my computer, it says “NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060.” Then go to this link and click the “CUDA-Enabled NVIDIA Quadro and NVIDIA RTX” and “CUDA-Enabled GeForce and TITAN Products” blocks to open their accordions. Then search for your graphics card’s model number (the left tables are for desktop cards and the right tables are for notebook cards). I found “GeForce RTX 2060” on the list under GeForce and TITAN Products with a compute capability of 7.5. Thus, my card is supported!"

    "text": "Wrap-up\nIf you want to save the transcript, you can enter the following command in the R console: saveRDS(out, \"malanga.rds\") and it will create a serialized R data file containing all the transcript data (e.g., text and time stamps). By default, this file will be saved in the same folder on your Windows file system that you ran the Command Prompt app from (e.g., “C:/Users/jeffg”). However, you can save anywhere using WSL’s /mnt/ system. For example, if you wanted to save it to “C:/Users/jeffg/Desktop”, then you would use \"/mnt/c/users/jeffg/Desktop/malanga.rds\" as the second argument to saveRDS(). Or if you wanted to save it to a mapped network drive like “Z:/affcomlab/transcription”, then you would use \"/mnt/z/affcomlab/transcription/malanga.rds\".\nThat wraps up this blog post. In the next part, I will discuss more practical aspects of using this technology. For example, I’ll talk about how to generate a list of audio/videos files on your hard drive (or elsewhere) and then iterate over them to create transcripts from many files all at once.\nPart 3 coming soon…"

    "text": "Research Topics\n\nClinical Topics\n\nDepression – We are interested in improving the assessment and treatment of depression. In particular, we are interested in (a) developing computational depression screening tools that can be deployed in under-served (e.g., remote or low resource) communities, (b) studying the connections between mood, depression, and interpersonal functioning, and (c) understanding the psychotherapeutic processes that contribute to recovery from depression.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder – We are interested in how individuals who survive traumatic events respond to, make sense of, and communicate about their experiences. Toward this end, we collect and analyze trauma narratives and impact statements from patients seeking treatment for PTSD and from community members who experienced traumatic events but did not develop PTSD. We are using observational methods to measure and analyze the patterns of behaviors, emotions, and cognitions evident in these narratives and statements. Our goals are to improve PTSD assessment and to deepen clinical understanding of the psychological processes that contribute to the development, maintenance, and recovery from PTSD.\nStructure of psychopathology – We are interested in advancing scientific knowledge about the ways in which psychiatric signs and symptoms organize into transdiagnostic dimensions or “spectra.” As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the “Bass-Ackwards” factor analytical technique (Goldberg, 2006; Forbes, 2020). We are also interested in disentangling measures of dysfunction and traits/symptoms.\nBehavioral synchrony – We are interested in studying the emergence of behavioral synchronization between members of interacting dyads (e.g., therapists and patients or parents and children). We are applying this to studying the development of the working alliance (i.e., therapeutic relationship) during psychotherapy for depression and the communication dynamics between parents and children at high risk of suicide. As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the windowed cross-correlation technique for quantifying behavioral synchrony (Boker et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nMethodological Topics\n\nInterrater reliability statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that quantify the degree of reliability (e.g., agreement or consistency) between raters in observational and judgment studies. As part of this effort, we are working on finalizing the agreement R package for chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement and are working on integrating insights and tools from Bayesian statistics and generalizability theory in the varde R pacakge.\nCircumplex statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that leverage the circular structure of circumplex models of affect and interpersonal functioning. As part of this effort, we are working on expanding the circumplex R package with additional functionality and developing new extensions of the Structural Summary Method (Gurtman, 1992; Zimmermann & Wright, 2017) that accommodate multilevel (e.g., clustered and longitudinal) data and latent variables.\nObservational methods – We are interested in measuring behavior as it actually occurs using human and algorithmic observers. Toward this end, we are working on creating databases of observational records (e.g., videos) to share with other researchers and are developing software and educational resources to aid in the collection and analysis of observational data.\nApplied machine learning – We are interested in applying recent advances in predictive modeling techniques to the study of human behavior (e.g., to aid in clinical decision-making and observational measurement). We are particularly interested in model evaluation, explanation, and comparison techniques that combine insights and techniques from statistical inference and machine learning.\nBayesian multilevel modeling – We are interested in leveraging the wonderful flexibility of Bayesian mixed effects models to answer applied questions about multilevel (e.g., clustered or longitudinal) data. We are also interested in adapting this framework to improve estimation in other topics (e.g., inter-rater reliability statistics, circumplex statistics, and comparing machine learning models)."

    "text": "Research Framework\n\nAffective Communication\nThe substantive focus of our work is on how humans communicate important affective (e.g., emotional) information to one another. The four pillars of this work are on structure, context, dynamics, and functionality. In studying the structure of affective communication, we investigate the production and perception of visual behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and body motion), vocal behaviors (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre), and verbal behaviors (e.g., syntax, semantics, and discourse). In studying the context of affective communication, we investigate the influence of the immediate and distal sociocultural environment. In studying the dynamics of affective communication, we investigate the unfolding of emotion, behavior, and the interpersonal field over time. Finally, in studying the functionality of affective communication, we investigate its relationships with mental health, pathology, and recovery.\n\n\n\nAffective Computing\nSupporting the four pillars of substantive research described above is a methodological foundation of computer and data science. The three main aspects of this methodological work are statistics, computing, and design. The statistical aspects largely focus on developing and applying Bayesian, multilevel, and latent variable models to test hypotheses about interpretable parameters or validate the other aspects. The computational aspects largely focus on building tools to collect large amounts of data and then using machine learning to process that data and make predictions. Finally, the design aspects largely focus on developing software to collect, process, and analyze research data as well as websites to educate researchers on methodological and substantive topics."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn a previous blog post on AI Transcription, I discussed the performance benefits of moving to WSL2 for CUDA support on Windows. However, the process of setting up and using the virtual machine was very technical, which may be a barrier for many users. In this blog post, I will discuss the use of a technology called Docker to ease the setup and use of WSL2.\nDocker is a tool that makes it easy to package and run applications in a “container,” which is a lightweight, standalone environment that includes everything an application needs to run. This way, the application will work the same way on any computer without worrying about setup or compatibility issues.\nThere are three main components to Docker: a Dockerfile, a Docker image, and a Docker container. To explain these, I will use a pizza analogy. Just like a chef might create a recipe that contains step-by-step instructions for preparing a pizza, a power user might create a Dockerfile that contains detailed and reproducible instructions for building and configuring a software environment. This recipe might then be followed in a food processing plant to produce many identical pizzas, which are then frozen for re-sale. Similarly, the Dockerfile instructions might be followed to “build” a Docker image, which contains all the resulting files and settings. Finally, a customer might purchase a frozen pizza, bring it home, and reheat it in their own oven for consumption. In much the same way, a user might download or “pull” a Docker image from the internet and “run” it as a Docker container on their own computer to use the desired application. The benefit of this approach is that the customer/user doesn’t need to understand or even know about the recipe/Dockerfile instructions to enjoy the pizza/container!\nI have played the role of chef or power user here and condensed the instructions from my previous blog post into a Dockerfile and built it into a Docker image that you can easily pull and run.\nBefore we dive into things, I’ll provide a brief overview of all the steps.\n\nCheck that our computer’s hardware supports CUDA\nInstall/update the NVIDIA graphics driver on Windows\nInstall Docker Desktop on Windows\nPull the preconfigured Docker image\nRun the Docker image with GPU support\nLog into RStudio Server and use audio.whisper"

    "text": "Check for CUDA Support\nThis post assumes that you are using the Windows operating system and that your computer’s graphics card supports CUDA. To check that this is the case, first look up your graphics card’s model number. An easy way to do this on Windows 10/11 is to click on the desktop search bar (bottom-left of the screen next to the windows icon) and type in “Device Manager.” Then click the arrow next to “Display adapters” and find your graphics card’s model name. On my computer, it says “NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060.” Then go to this link and click the “CUDA-Enabled NVIDIA Quadro and NVIDIA RTX” and “CUDA-Enabled GeForce and TITAN Products” blocks to open their accordions. Then search for your graphics card’s model number (the left tables are for desktop cards and the right tables are for notebook cards). I found “GeForce RTX 2060” on the list under GeForce and TITAN Products with a compute capability of 7.5. Thus, my card is supported!"

I will first show you how to quickly install the audio.whisper R package and transcribe an example file. However, the processing will be very slow and we can do much, much better if we offload some of the work to a dedicated graphics card, such as an Nvidia card with CUDA.

Earlier entries on that list are smaller (to download and hold in RAM), faster, and less accurate whereas later entries are larger, slower, and more accurate. There are also English-only versions of all but the large model, which end in \".en\" as in \"base.en\", and these may be more efficient if you know that all speech will be in English. You can learn more about these models via ?whisper_download_model. For this tutorial, we will go with the \"base\" model.\n\n# Load package from library\nlibrary(audio.whisper)\n\n\n# Download or load from file the desired whisper model\nmodel &lt;- whisper(\"base\")\n## whisper_init_from_file_with_params_no_state: loading model from 'C:/GitHub/affcomlab/posts/whisper2024/ggml-base.bin'\n## whisper_model_load: loading model\n## whisper_model_load: n_vocab       = 51865\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_ctx   = 1500\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_state = 512\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_head  = 8\n## whisper_model_load: n_audio_layer = 6\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_ctx    = 448\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_state  = 512\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_head   = 8\n## whisper_model_load: n_text_layer  = 6\n## whisper_model_load: n_mels        = 80\n## whisper_model_load: ftype         = 1\n## whisper_model_load: qntvr         = 0\n## whisper_model_load: type          = 2 (base)\n## whisper_model_load: adding 1608 extra tokens\n## whisper_model_load: n_langs       = 99\n## whisper_model_load:      CPU buffer size =   147.46 MB\n## whisper_model_load: model size    =  147.37 MB\n## whisper_init_state: kv self size  =   16.52 MB\n## whisper_init_state: kv cross size =   18.43 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (conv)   =   14.86 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (encode) =   85.99 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (cross)  =    4.78 MB\n## whisper_init_state: compute buffer (decode) =   96.48 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the larger models may take a while to download, so if you get an error that the download took longer than permitted, you can temporarily allow more time via: options(timeout = 300).\n\n\n\n\nTranscribe example file\nThe package comes with an example audio file in the proper format, which contains 11 seconds of a speech by John F. Kennedy Jr. Let’s load it from file using system.file() and then transcribe it using predict().\n\n# Construct file path to example audio file in package data\njfk &lt;- system.file(package = \"audio.whisper\", \"samples\", \"jfk.wav\")\n\n# Run English transcription using the downloaded whisper model\nout &lt;- predict(model, newdata = jfk, language = \"en\")\n\n# Print transcript\nout$data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsegment\nsegment_offset\nfrom\nto\ntext\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n00:00:00.000\n00:00:11.000\nAnd so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results look good! But we can see how long this took by digging into the output object.\n\n# Examine the time elapsed to process this audio\nout$timing\n## $transcription_start\n## [1] \"2024-08-15 12:30:48 CDT\"\n## \n## $transcription_end\n## [1] \"2024-08-15 12:51:48 CDT\"\n## \n## $transcription_duration\n## Time difference of 20.98786 mins\n\nYikes, 21 minutes to process just 11 seconds of audio. That’s motivation to work on the CUDA version to speed things up. But before we move on to that, I’ll first show you how to extract audio from a video file and convert it to the format that Whisper wants.\n\n\nExtract and format audio\nDownload the example mlk.mp4 video file, which contains 12 seconds of a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. This video contains an audio stream in AAC format with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. However, whisper requires audio files in WAV format with a sampling rate of 16 kHz. We can extract and convert it in one step using the av_audio_convert() function from the av package.\n\n# Install av package if you don't have it already\n# install.packages(\"av\")\n\n# Load package from library\nlibrary(av)\n\n# Extract and convert audio\nav_audio_convert(\n  \"mlk.mp4\", \n  output = \"mlk.wav\", \n  format = \"wav\", \n  sample_rate = 16000\n)\n## [1] \"C:\\\\GitHub\\\\affcomlab\\\\posts\\\\whisper2024\\\\mlk.wav\"\n\nNote that the process would have been identical if this had been an audio file in a different format rather than a video file - you would just replace the .mp4 file with the audio file (e.g., .mp3). Now let’s transcribe this and verify that our conversion worked.\n\n# Run English transcription using the downloaded whisper model\nout2 &lt;- predict(model, newdata = \"mlk.wav\", language = \"en\")\n\n# Print transcript\nout2$data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsegment\nsegment_offset\nfrom\nto\ntext\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n00:00:00.000\n00:00:02.000\nI have a dream.\n\n\n2\n0\n00:00:02.000\n00:00:12.000\nBut one day, this nation will rise up, live up the true meaning of its creed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot perfect (swapped “that” for “but” and omitted an “and”) but pretty good. And this only the base model - it might do better with a larger model, but for time’s sake I’ll leave that until after we get CUDA working in Part 2.\n\nContinue to Part 2  »"

What is going on here? Basically, what mutate() did was take all the numbers in x1, x2, and x3, combine them into one long vector of 30 numbers, and send that vector to the mean() function. The mean() function then returns a single value—the mean of all 30 numbers—and tries to put that into the new column xmean. But because the column needs to be a vector of 10 numbers to fit into the tibble, that single value gets recycled (i.e., repeated 10 times). To verify this is what happened, we can do the operation by hand and see that we get the same number:\n\nmean(c(x1, x2, x3))\n\n[1] 10.79233\n\n\nSo, clearly mutate() is not doing what we intended it to do."

    "text": "The across() approach\nLuckily, dplyr 1.0.0 added some great features for doing operations within rows. The simplest version simply adds a call to the rowwise() function to our pipeline before the mutate().\n\n# Example 2 (works but slow)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt;  \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c(x1, x2, x3)))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n# Rowwise: \n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  8.28\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4 11.0 \n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9 12.9 \n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8 11.0 \n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  7.25\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  3.34\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  8.95\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  9.16\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9 17.0 \n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4 19.1 \n\n\nThis did what we wanted it to do, despite the actual mutate() call being identical to what is was before! Pretty cool. We can even save some time by selecting the variables to include in the mean() operation automatically, instead of listing them out in the c() function. This isn’t such a time-savings in this case with only three variables, but in settings with more variables it can really add up. To do so, we just need to use a tidy selection function; in this case, all the variables we want to include start with the letter “x” so let’s use starts_with().\n\n# Example 3 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise()|&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(starts_with(\"x\")))\n\nError in `mutate()`:\nℹ In argument: `xmean = mean(starts_with(\"x\"))`.\nℹ In row 1.\nCaused by error:\n! `starts_with()` must be used within a *selecting* function.\nℹ See &lt;https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-selection-context.html&gt; for\n  details.\n\n\nShoot, that didn’t work. But why not? Basically, the problem is that mutate() doesn’t know what do to with selection functions like starts_with(). The error message basically says that we are in the “wrong context” for a selection function."

    "title": "Row-wise means in dplyr",
    "section": "Remember to ungroup()",
    "text": "Remember to ungroup()\nThere are two things to note about rowwise(), however. First, it transformed our tibble into an implicitly “grouped” tibble, which is what allowed our mutate() function to calculate row-wise means instead of overall means (basically, it is treating each row as a separate group and calculating the means per group/row). However, after that mutate() call, the tibble remains grouped. This is handy if we want to continue doing row-wise operations, but how do we tell it to stop once we are done with row-wise operations and want to return to “normal” behavior? Let’s see when this could be a problem; one example is if we want to calculate the maximum row-wise mean xmean_max.\n\n# Example 5 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c_across(starts_with(\"x\")))) |&gt; \n  summarize(xmean_max = max(xmean))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n   xmean_max\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      8.28\n 2     11.0 \n 3     12.9 \n 4     11.0 \n 5      7.25\n 6      3.34\n 7      8.95\n 8      9.16\n 9     17.0 \n10     19.1 \n\n\nHere we wanted to summarize over all values of xmean and expected a single maximum value. Instead we got the same 10 values back. What happened? Basically, our tibble was still implicitly grouped by row and the summarize() function respected that, calculating the maximum of each group/row. To avoid this behavior, we can add the ungroup() function to our pipeline (reverting the tibble back to a standard one without implicit grouping).\n\n# Example 6 (works but slow)\nn10 |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = mean(c_across(starts_with(\"x\")))) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  summarize(xmean_max = max(xmean))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  xmean_max\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      19.1\n\n\nNow we get the desired behavior, and so I am usually very careful to add ungroup() to my pipeline as soon as I am done with row-wise operations (otherwise you might end up with some unexpected problems)."

    "title": "Row-wise means in dplyr",
    "section": "Faster means with rowMeans()",
    "text": "Faster means with rowMeans()\nThe other thing to note about rowwise() is that it can be slow. With a small tibble like this, it doesn’t matter much, but the difference could be meaningful for larger and more complex data. In these cases, you have some alternatives. This blog post describes some of them, but does not address the specific case of means, which is what I want to do the most in practice. A faster alternative in this case is to use the rowMeans() function. As you might imagine, this function takes in a numeric matrix or dataframe and returns the mean of each row.\n\nrowMeans(n10)\n\n [1] 30.89482 29.57077 27.64172 32.52192 28.06156 31.59763 28.28442 35.62799\n [9] 36.23378 37.56994\n\n\nBut we want to exclude the y variable and append it to the n10 tibble. How can we do so? We might reasonably try to put it into mutate() like we did with mean():\n\n# Example 7 (doesn't work)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = rowMeans(c(x1, x2, x3)))\n\nError in `mutate()`:\nℹ In argument: `xmean = rowMeans(c(x1, x2, x3))`.\nCaused by error in `rowMeans()`:\n! 'x' must be an array of at least two dimensions\n\n\nBut here we run into a problem. rowMeans() is expecting a numeric matrix or data frame, but is being provided with a vector of 30 numbers again (as in Example 1). Thus, it doesn’t have rows to calculate means within and returns an error. We can solve this by transforming the vector to a matrix:\n\n# Example 8 (works but inconvenient)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = rowMeans(matrix(c(x1, x2, x3), ncol = 3)))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  8.28\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4 11.0 \n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9 12.9 \n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8 11.0 \n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  7.25\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  3.34\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  8.95\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  9.16\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9 17.0 \n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4 19.1 \n\n\nBut this is inconvenient and error prone. Luckily, dplyr 1.1.0 added a way to streamline this kind of thing. We can use the new pick() function to create this context. Note that we are using pick() here instead of c_across() because the latter is for working within rows (in combination with rowwise()) and here we want the row-wise operations to be handled by rowMeans().\n\n# Example 9 (works and convenient and fast)\nn10 |&gt; \n  mutate(xmean = rowMeans(pick(starts_with(\"x\"))))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n       y     x1    x2    x3 xmean\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  98.7  0.327  5.88  18.6  8.28\n 2  85.3 -0.413  7.06  26.4 11.0 \n 3  71.9  0.562 22.2   15.9 12.9 \n 4  97.2  0.663 12.4   19.8 11.0 \n 5  90.5 -0.603  5.55  16.8  7.25\n 6 116.   0.698 -8.48  17.8  3.34\n 7  86.3  0.596  3.71  22.5  8.95\n 8 115.   0.452  1.39  25.6  9.16\n 9  94.0  0.897 25.1   24.9 17.0 \n10  93.0  0.572 37.4   19.4 19.1 \n\n\nTo test the speed of each approach, we can use the microbenchmark package, which will precisely time each approach over multiple iterations (in this case, 100).

So, although I think it is worth learning the new rowwise() and c_across() functions, in settings where observations are many and speed in paramount, it may be worthwhile to learn “parallel” functions such as rowMeans(), rowSums(), pmin(), pmax(), and paste()."

    "text": "Are you accepting applications for new graduate students?\nYes! I am planning to review applications for graduate students to start in Fall 2023 and may admit one or two Psychology PhD students across the Clinical Psychological Science (CPS) and Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) programs. The application deadline for both programs is December 1, 2022.\n\n\nWhat does your lab study?\nThe AffCom lab develops and uses technology to advance scientific understanding of how emotional, social, and mental health-related information is communicated through verbal and nonverbal behavior. Our work is eclectic and spans basic science on emotion and behavior; clinical science on assessment and treatment; and methodological science on the collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of research data.\n\n\nWhat are your research plans for the near future?\nIn the next few years, I plan to study (1) how therapists and patients with depression communicate during psychotherapy sessions, (2) how individuals with and without a history of trauma communicate their experiences and construct narratives, (3) how psychotic symptoms affect the production of communicative behavior, and (4) how technology can be used to more precisely measure emotional expressiveness in both healthy and clinical populations. I am also planning to work on software related to inter-rater agreement, hierarchical latent variable modeling, and web-based video annotation. See the research page for more information.\n\n\nShould I apply to work with you at KU?\nI welcome applications from all qualified students regardless of background. However, admissions are competitive, and applications are not free; thus, I want to give applicants a better idea of what I am looking for so that they can make an informed decision about whether to invest their time and money.\nFirst, note that I currently only advise PhD students in the CPS and BBQ programs. The psychology department does not offer a terminal Masters degree and I am not affiliated with the Child Clinical Psychology program. Second, note that my lab does not specialize in neuroscience or do much brain-focused research (i.e., we skew more towards the behavior and quantitative side of the BBQ program).\nThe primary criteria I use to evaluate applications are (1) evidence of the applicant’s ability to succeed in a research-focused PhD program, (2) a match between the applicant’s academic interests/experiences and my own areas of interest/expertise, and (3) a match between the applicant’s interpersonal style and my own.\nTo be competitive for admission, applicants should have (1) a strong academic record with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in psychology or a related field, (2) previous experience working/volunteering in one or more research labs, (3) a high level of maturity and professionalism conducive to collaborative and/or clinical work, and (4) a direct connection to my area of research such as through previous coursework, research experience, or independent study.\n\n\nWhat is the funding situation for graduate students?\nI would not take on a graduate student if I did not believe that I could provide them full funding (tuition remission, stipend, and benefits) for four to five years. Funding comes primarily from teaching assistantships, although research assistantships and scholarships are also possibilities. Supplemental summer funding is also often possible depending on our success in securing research grants.\n\n\nWhat is your stance on scientific reform?\nI am committed to making my science more transparent, open, reproducible, and accountable though the (1) sharing of research preprints, materials, and data, (2) transparent description of hypotheses and methods, and (3) use and development of free and open-source software.\n\n\nCan potential applicants meet with you before applying?\nDue to the high number of inquiries I receive each year, it is unfortunately not possible for me to meet with potential applicants. However, I will carefully review every application that lists my name and those applicants who are invited to interview will have the opportunity to speak with me one-on-one.\n\n\nCan potential applicants speak to students in the lab?\nSimilar to the question above, applicants who are invited to interview will have the opportunity to speak to graduate students and research assistants in the lab (as well as various other members of the department).\n\n\nHow do I apply?\nAdmission information and links can be found on the Psychology Graduate Program webpage. Scroll down and open the “Admission” accordion or click on one of the “Application Instructions” links. You will need to submit a curriculum vitae, statement of purpose, three letters of recommendations, and transcripts."

Clinically, Dr. Welch is a voice-specialized, nationally certified speech-language pathologist who frequently helps patients navigate how factors like identity, personality, and trauma relate to their voice and communication. Building off this clinical background, his line of research seeks to examine both the psychological factors contributing to voice and communication disorders, as well as how one’s voice and communication influences their psycho-social well-being. To interrogate these relationships, Dr. Welch leverages contemporary quantitative methods with empirical frameworks of individual differences and transdiagnostic approaches to psychopathology.\nHe completed his doctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. Leah B. Helou in the Department of Communication Science and Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the interdisciplinary Affective Communication and Computing Lab in the Department of Psychology at the University of Kansas under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Girard. In addition to being cross trained in Psychology and furthering his knowledge of advanced quantitative methods, Dr. Welch is working with Dr. Girard to further our understanding of voice and speech as a biomarker of psychopathology by integrating current best practices in voice and speech science.\nDr. Welch seeks to continue researching these so-called psycho-social-vocal relationships as a tenure-track independent investigator at a research institution. By continuing to understand these relationships, he hopes to advance evidence-based medicine and improve assessment, treatment, and outcomes for patients working with speech-language pathologists."

He expects to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a B.A. in psychology and sociology. Furthermore, he intends to pursue higher studies in either clinical or counseling psychology.\nResearch interests include: Mental health, counseling, and different clinical and counseling intervention methods. Patterns of thinking and maladaptive schemas, assessing the psychological functioning of individuals during depressive episodes and recovery periods. What exactly leads to depressive thoughts and thinking, and how do escape such episodes. How do depressed individuals cope with varying levels of depression while being on or off medicine? The role of personality type, personality disorder, and family upbringing in shaping one’s worldview and ways of dealing with stress, stressors, and negative emotions. Is all the theoretical side of psychology bad/hard to measure nowadays? How much of Freudian and Jungian theory still holds today? How valid and reliable is it to combine theoretical and clinically proven techniques together? How big is the room for improvisation in clinical settings?\nFinally, can a healthy lifestyle with a supporting circle of friends and loved ones and dedication to a hobby or holding a job that one is passionate about being able to supplant the role of medication? What if one is diagnosed with clinical depression and is unable to function while being medicated? What is the best way to lessen the symptoms of such an individual?"

    "text": "For Undergraduate Students\nThe lab is frequently home to undergraduate students from the Psychology and Behavioral Neuroscience departments (and occasionally others).\nUndergraduate students work as research assistants, learning about the scientific method and assisting in the collection and processing of research data. Many enroll in PSYC 480 and receive credit hours for this work. Research assistants attend weekly lab meetings and can expect a letter of recommendation from Dr. Girard describing their work in and contributions to the lab (please give one month of advanced notice). Opportunities to earn co-authorship on research products (e.g., conference presentations) are also occasionally offered to advanced research assistants.\nHonors students will also occasionally design and complete an independent research project (i.e., honors thesis) under the supervision of Dr. Girard over the course of their senior year. These students typically apply for (and have often won) research awards of $1000 from the Center for Undergraduate Research and make oral or poster presentations about their work at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.\nApply to be a Research Assistant"

They will receive a world-class education in the scientific method and have many opportunities to contribute to ongoing research projects.\nMore information about each admissions cycle can be found on the News page.\nApply to the BBQ Program\nApply to the CPS Program"

    "section": "Project Summary",
    "text": "Project Summary\nWhich psychiatric symptoms and behaviors are the most important to assess and manage during critical points in psychiatric healthcare, such as the time leading up to hospital discharge? At present, psychiatry lacks objective tests that could inform this and other clinically challenging–and potentially costly–decisions. Establishing valid objective markers of psychiatric disease processes is especially challenging compared with the development of biomarkers in other fields. One key challenge is lack of available data from psychiatrically ill patients during key periods in their care trajectory, which the present project seeks to address. A second major challenge, also addressed as a core feature in this project, is the complex, context-dependence of human behavioral expression, which greatly complicates efforts to establish robust, objective measures that reflect underlying mental health disease processes. This project will address both barriers, introducing a new computational framework, named Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics, to identify and evaluate behavioral biomarkers related to discharge-readiness and symptoms in severe mental illness. The project aims to address five fundamental research challenges: (1) Acquire a multimodal psychiatric discharge-planning dataset of 400 inpatients with severe mental illness; (2) Create self-aware linear and neural models to identify multimodal behavioral biomarkers; (3) Develop context-sensitive linear and neural models to contextualize behavioral biomarkers and quantify the influence of context on behavior; (4) Build a new adaptive assessment planning framework which creates a personalized patient analysis to rank contexts and modalities for the next assessment session; (5) Assess the trustworthiness and generalizability of our measurements, models, and insights. This research will improve basic understanding of social context and behavioral biomarkers, build objective measures for mental health assessment, and more broadly, pave the way for a restructured care-delivery system in which resources are allocated intelligently to ensure assessments are informative with respect to desired clinical objectives."

This project will: (1) deepen our understanding of the trajectory leading to hospitalization discharge with knowledge about behavioral biomarkers and their relationship to symptoms and discharge-readiness; (2) contribute to the knowledge on how social context impacts patient’s behaviors since some symptoms or predictive biomarkers may only be seen in a specific context such as social or solitary interactions; and (3) contribute a credible, objective framework for behavioral measurement by defining interpretable biomarkers and latent factors for symptoms and discharge assessment. The project will also enable a judicious use of remote sensing and non-direct clinical encounters (e.g., telemedicine), which are increasingly viewed as essential capabilities in the medical fields to reduce costs while maintaining or elevating care standards."

    "section": "Project Summary",
    "text": "Project Summary\nSuicide continues to be a growing public health concern. Indeed, suicide rates have increased 33% since 1999. This concern has been particularly pronounced in the case of adolescents, as the suicide rates in this age group have tripled over the last 10 years. Clarifying potential processes of risk for suicidal behavior in this population therefore remains a pressing priority. Increasing theoretical and empirical focus has been devoted to the conceptualization of acute suicidal risk as being a period of elevated arousal. Stress within parent-child relationship dynamics may hold particular importance for understanding adolescents’ proximal risk for suicidal behavior. However, all past studies examining parent-child relationship stress and suicidal behavior have used self-report methodologies and/or retrospective recall. Although studies employing these methodologies provide important knowledge about the association between life stress and mental health outcomes, they are not designed to characterize the interpersonal dynamics of these stressors as they unfold over time, which may be particularly relevant to short-term suicide risk. Recent advances in computational approaches to automatic sensing of acoustic and visual behaviors hold promise to address the need for clarifying indices of arousal in parent-child dynamics associated with adolescent suicide risk. A novel method to assess familial stress processes is through the automated assessment of synchrony, or the behavioral matching, of arousal between adolescents and their parents. In healthy parent-child dyads, parents and adolescents are responsive to each other’s behavioral and emotional cues. However, during high stress or conflict, behavioral matching may be a marker of a high-risk interaction pattern inasmuch as it may be indicative of high arousal maintenance or escalation. Focusing on the RDoC constructs of arousal and social processes, the current R21 proposal aims to leverage recent developments in automated sensing of acoustic and visual behavior to characterize synchrony within the dynamics of a parent-child conflict task in a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents (n = 100) and their parents. The current study aims to evaluate whether acoustic and visual behavioral markers of arousal synchrony, respectively, are associated with prospective suicidal ideation three months post-discharge. We also aim to pool acoustic and visual behavioral markers of parent-child arousal synchrony through computational modeling to create a multimodal prediction model for prospective suicidal ideation, thereby to advance beyond unimodal analysis to multimodal analysis in classifying suicide risk. This R21 is intended as an initial step toward automating the assessment of parent-child arousal synchrony within clinical contexts to inform clinical decision-making and interventions. This proposal has both scientific and clinical significance because it is the first study to employ computational automation of acoustic and visual markers of suicide risk at the dyadic level and has the potential directly to inform adolescent suicide risk assessment and intervention."

An easy way to do this on Windows 10/11 is to click on the desktop search bar (bottom-left of the screen next to the windows icon) and type in “Device Manager.” Then click the arrow next to “Display adapters” and find your graphics card’s model name. On my computer, it says “NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060.” Then go to this link and click the “CUDA-Enabled NVIDIA Quadro and NVIDIA RTX” and “CUDA-Enabled GeForce and TITAN Products” blocks to open their accordions. Then search for your graphics card’s model number (the left tables are for desktop cards and the right tables are for notebook cards). I found “GeForce RTX 2060” on the list under GeForce and TITAN Products with a compute capability of 7.5. Thus, my card is supported!"

    "text": "Research Topics\n\nClinical Topics\n\nDepression – We are interested in improving the assessment and treatment of depression. In particular, we are interested in (a) developing computational depression screening tools that can be deployed in under-served (e.g., remote or low resource) communities, (b) studying the connections between mood, depression, and interpersonal functioning, and (c) understanding the psychotherapeutic processes that contribute to recovery from depression.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder – We are interested in how individuals who survive traumatic events respond to, make sense of, and communicate about their experiences. Toward this end, we collect and analyze trauma narratives and impact statements from patients seeking treatment for PTSD and from community members who experienced traumatic events but did not develop PTSD. We are using observational methods to measure and analyze the patterns of behaviors, emotions, and cognitions evident in these narratives and statements. Our goals are to improve PTSD assessment and to deepen clinical understanding of the psychological processes that contribute to the development, maintenance, and recovery from PTSD.\nClinical decision-making – We are interested in developing tools to support the clinical decision-making of mental healthcare workers such as (a) determining the optimal time to discharge psychiatric inpatients from the hospital, and (b) estimating patients’ risk of dropping out of psychotherapy early. This topic is deeply connected to the methodology of predictive machine learning (see below).\nStructure of psychopathology – We are interested in advancing scientific knowledge about the ways in which psychiatric signs and symptoms organize into transdiagnostic dimensions or “spectra.” As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the “Bass-Ackwards” factor analytical technique (Goldberg, 2006; Forbes, 2020). We are also interested in disentangling measures of dysfunction and traits/symptoms.\nBehavioral synchrony – We are interested in studying the emergence of behavioral synchronization between members of interacting dyads (e.g., therapists and patients or parents and children). We are applying this to studying the development of the working alliance (i.e., therapeutic relationship) during psychotherapy for depression and the communication dynamics between parents and children at high risk of suicide. As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the windowed cross-correlation technique for quantifying behavioral synchrony (Boker et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nMethodological Topics\n\nInterrater reliability statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that quantify the degree of reliability (e.g., agreement or consistency) between raters in observational and judgment studies. As part of this effort, we are working on finalizing the agreement R package for chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement and are working on integrating insights and tools from Bayesian statistics and generalizability theory in the varde R pacakge.\nCircumplex statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that leverage the circular structure of circumplex models of affect and interpersonal functioning. As part of this effort, we are working on expanding the circumplex R package with additional functionality and developing new extensions of the Structural Summary Method (Gurtman, 1992; Zimmermann & Wright, 2017) that accommodate multilevel (e.g., clustered and longitudinal) data and latent variables.\nObservational methods – We are interested in measuring behavior as it actually occurs using human and algorithmic observers. Toward this end, we are working on creating databases of observational records (e.g., videos) to share with other researchers and are developing software and educational resources to aid in the collection and analysis of observational data.\nApplied machine learning – We are interested in applying recent advances in predictive modeling techniques to the study of human behavior (e.g., to aid in clinical decision-making and observational measurement). We are particularly interested in model evaluation, explanation, and comparison techniques that combine insights and techniques from statistical inference and machine learning.\nBayesian multilevel modeling – We are interested in leveraging the wonderful flexibility of Bayesian mixed effects models to answer applied questions about multilevel (e.g., clustered or longitudinal) data. We are also interested in adapting this framework to improve estimation in other topics (e.g., inter-rater reliability statistics, circumplex statistics, and comparing machine learning models)."

The four pillars of this work are on structure, context, dynamics, and functionality. In studying the structure of affective communication, we investigate the production and perception of visual behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and body motion), vocal behaviors (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre), and verbal behaviors (e.g., syntax, semantics, and discourse). In studying the context of affective communication, we investigate the influence of the immediate and distal sociocultural environment. In studying the dynamics of affective communication, we investigate the unfolding of emotion, behavior, and the interpersonal field over time. Finally, in studying the functionality of affective communication, we investigate its relationships with mental health, pathology, and recovery.\n\n\n\nAffective Computing\nSupporting the four pillars of substantive research described above is a methodological foundation of computer and data science. The three main aspects of this methodological work are statistics, computing, and design. The statistical aspects largely focus on developing and applying Bayesian, multilevel, and latent variable models to test hypotheses about interpretable parameters or validate the other aspects. The computational aspects largely focus on building tools to collect large amounts of data and then using machine learning to process that data and make predictions. Finally, the design aspects largely focus on developing software to collect, process, and analyze research data as well as websites to educate researchers on methodological and substantive topics."

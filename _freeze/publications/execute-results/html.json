Yet our understanding of how alcohol impacts emotion as assessed across diverse response modalities remains incomplete. The present study leverages a social alcohol-administration paradigm to assess drinking-related emotions, aiming to elucidate impacts of intoxication on self-reported versus behaviorally expressed emotion. Method: Participants (N = 60; Mage = 22.5; 50\\% male; 55\\% White) attended two counterbalanced laboratory sessions, on one of which they were administered an alcoholic beverage (target blood alcohol content .08\\%) and on the other a nonalcoholic control beverage. Participants in both conditions were accurately informed of beverage contents and consumed study beverages in assigned groups of three while their behavior was videotaped. Emotion was assessed via self-report as well as continuous coding of facial muscle movements. Results: The relationship between self-reported and behaviorally expressed emotion diverged significantly across beverage conditions: positive affect: b = -0.174, t = -2.36, p = .022; negative affect, b = 0.4319, t = 2.37, p = .021. Specifically, self-reports and behavioral displays converged among sober but not intoxicated participants. Further, alcohol's effects on positive facial displays remained significant in models controlling for self-reported positive and negative emotion, with alcohol enhancing Duchenne smiles 20\\% beyond effects captured via self-reports, pointing to unique effects of alcohol on behavioral indicators of positive emotion. Conclusions: Findings highlight effects of acute intoxication on the convergence and divergence of emotion measures, thus informing our understanding of measures for capturing emotions that are most proximal to drinking and thus most immediately reinforcing of alcohol consumption.

Computational approaches offer new opportunities to analyze expressive behavior (e.g., facial expressions, vocal prosody, and language use) with greater precision and efficiency. This paper provides an accessible conceptual framework for understanding how methods from computer vision, speech signal processing, and natural language processing can enhance clinical assessment. We outline the goals, frameworks, and methods of both clinical and computational approaches, and present an illustrative review of interdisciplinary research applying these techniques across a range of mental health conditions. We also examine key challenges related to data quality, measurement, interdisciplinarity, and ethics. Finally, we highlight future directions for building systems that are robust, interpretable, and clinically meaningful.

The published literature on mental health disorders among Hispanic individuals, however, is not robust, and their experience of depressive disorders remains poorly understood. The construct of acculturation may help elucidate the risk of depression among Hispanic Americans and may inform the development of appropriate policy and treatment resources. We examined the degree to which acculturation may interact with key demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status [SES], and Mexican ancestry) in accounting for depressive symptomatology among Hispanic Americans. We conducted a series of Bayesian generalized linear mixed models using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to investigate the self-reported depressive symptomatology (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) of Mexican Americans and other Hispanic individuals and to examine possible effects of acculturation and demographics on depressive symptomatology in this population. Mexican Americans had substantially lower levels of depression than other Hispanic individuals. Acculturation was positively associated with depression severity, but this effect was moderated by sex and SES. High acculturation was more strongly linked to depression among men and those of high SES. Acculturation and several demographic factors were associated with depressive symptomatology among Hispanic individuals. Acculturation can be useful in understanding risk, developing culturally informed interventions, and implementing community-level changes to address the burden of Hispanic depression.

We sought to clarify these relationships by applying more sophisticated dynamic and dyadic methods. Method: Adult outpatients with depression (N=65, Age 18-64, 65\\% Female, 68\\% White) participated in up to eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal psychotherapy. Sessions occurred either in-person or via teletherapy and were video-recorded. Facial computing tools estimated the momentary intensity of patients' and therapists' scowling and smiling, and the interpersonal synchrony of these measures during each session was quantified using windowed cross-correlation analyses. Hypotheses about within-dyad processes (i.e., session-to-session changes) and between-dyad associations (i.e., of average tendencies) were tested using hierarchical Bayesian mediation models. Results: Numerous and nuanced associations were found between facial behavior, working alliance, and treatment outcomes (e.g., session-to-session increases in patient-rated working alliance were predicted by higher-than-average therapist smiling). Interpersonal synchrony did not predict within-dyad changes in working alliance or depression symptoms; however, on the between-dyad level, higher average patient-rated working alliance was predicted by both higher average smile synchrony and lower average scowl synchrony. Conclusions: The facial behavior of patients and therapists provides a valuable window into the therapeutic process, especially with regard to the alliance. Contributions come from the behaviors of each person as well as their level of interpersonal synchrony. However, contrary to extant theories, the associations of synchrony with working alliance and outcomes depend on the behavior being synchronized, the informant providing ratings, and the level of analysis being conducted. Public Health Significance: These results help refine clinical theories about psychotherapy and unlock new possibilities for computationally assessing its progress.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2025a,\n  title = {Dynamic and Dyadic Relationships between Facial Behavior, Working Alliance, and Treatment Outcomes during Depression Therapy},\n  author = {Jeffrey M Girard and Dasha A Yermol and Lauren M Bylsma and Jeffrey F Cohn and Jay C Fournier and Louis-Philippe Morency and Holly A Swartz},\n  year = {2025},\n  journal = {Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}\n}</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-card\" data-key=\"campbell2025\">\n<div class=\"pub-title\">\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10949968251360683\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EXPRESS: How Influencers Grow: An Empirical Study and Future Research Agenda</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-meta\">\nCampbell, Girard, McDuff & Rosengren\n<br/>\n<em>Journal of Interactive Marketing</em>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-actions\">\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"abstract\" role=\"button\">Abstract</a>\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"citation\" role=\"button\">Citation</a>\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"bib\" role=\"button\">BibTeX</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"toggle-area\" data-current=\"\">\n<button class=\"copy-btn\">Copy</button>\n<span class=\"copy-toast\">Copied!</span>\n<div class=\"panel-label\">—</div>\n<div class=\"content\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:none;\">\n<div class=\"payload-abstract\">Most research on influencers takes the perspective of marketers, examining how influencers can be leveraged to build brands. However, as influencers grow in popularity, they are becoming a marketing force in their own right, warranting deeper exploration from their perspective. This paper shifts the focus to influencers as active marketers, using a multilevel mixed-effects growth model to identify factors associated with follower growth. Analyzing a dataset of 14,311,145 pieces of Instagram content posted over more than two years from 6,079 influencers across 57 countries, we examine how attention labor (content strategy and persona appeal) and relationship labor (captioning strategy and ecosystem connectivity) relate to follower growth. Whereas existing research primarily focuses on engagement with specific pieces of content, this study takes a broader approach, investigating how influencers' content and engagement strategies are associated with differences in follower growth over time. By reframing influencers as marketers rather than media vehicles, this study contributes to marketing theory and provides insights for influencers, influencer agencies, and marketers who seek to better understand influencer growth.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{campbell2025,\n  title = {{{EXPRESS}}: {{How}} Influencers Grow: An Empirical Study and Future Research Agenda},\n  author = {Colin Campbell and Jeffrey M.

A multimodal approach provides a more comprehensive understanding than any single modality (type of collected information) can provide on its own. Traditionally, clinicians and researchers have relied on their intuition, experience, and training to integrate different types of information in a psychotherapy session/treatment. Increasingly, however, computational methods offer a complementary alternative, enabling more automated, data-driven, and reproducible solutions. The six empirical examples in this special section illustrate the emerging---and often interdisciplinary---methodologies, including text, audio, video, and physiological measures, that are relevant in the psychotherapy setting. While each study addressed distinct research questions and employed unique methodologies, they all demonstrated a commitment to leveraging multimodal measurement and tackling the challenges of integrating diverse data sources.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{aafjes-vandoorn2025,\n  title = {From Intuition to Innovation: Empirical Illustrations of Multimodal Measurement in Psychotherapy Research},\n  author = {Katie {Aafjes-van Doorn} and Jeffrey M.

The social-personality conceptualization of narcissism often emphasizes high self-esteem as well as a range of associated maladaptive and adaptive outcomes. The clinical literature focuses on the pathological aspects of narcissism and highlights maladaptive aspects that correspond to the relationship between narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability. Reflecting these varying views of narcissism, many measures have become popular in the assessment of the construct, each with varying interpersonal characterizations. The current study (N\\,=\\,1,111) evaluated the interpersonal profiles captured by popular measures of narcissism and examined whether measures capture overlapping, differentiated, and/or intended interpersonal styles. Results revealed that measures of narcissism capture a wide range of interpersonal styles, from warm/dominant to submissive. However, most measures emphasize the role of interpersonal dominance in the measure content. Viewing narcissism from a three-factor structure, including narcissistic agency, antagonism, and vulnerability, helps to integrate the wide range of interpersonal styles apparent across narcissism measures. Furthermore, the level of (mal)adaptivity and general interpersonal style somewhat maps onto the literature of origin for the scales.

To develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end, we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over 4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents, telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents. Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@misc{agrawal2025,\n  title = {Seamless Interaction: {{Dyadic}} Audiovisual Motion Modeling and Large-Scale Dataset},\n  author = {Vasu Agrawal and Akinniyi Akinyemi and Kathryn Alvero and Morteza Behrooz and Julia Buffalini and Fabio Maria Carlucci and Joy Chen and Junming Chen and Zhang Chen and Shiyang Cheng and Praveen Chowdary and Joe Chuang and Antony D'Avirro and Jon Daly and Ning Dong and Mark Duppenthaler and Cynthia Gao and Jeff Girard and Martin Gleize and Sahir Gomez and Hongyu Gong and Srivathsan Govindarajan and Brandon Han and Sen He and Denise Hernandez and Yordan Hristov and Rongjie Huang and Hirofumi Inaguma and Somya Jain and Raj Janardhan and Qingyao Jia and Christopher Klaiber and Dejan Kovachev and Moneish Kumar and Hang Li and Yilei Li and Pavel Litvin and Wei Liu and Guangyao Ma and Jing Ma and Martin Ma and Xutai Ma and Lucas Mantovani and Sagar Miglani and Sreyas Mohan and Louis-Philippe Morency and Evonne Ng and Kam-Woh Ng and Tu Anh Nguyen and Amia Oberai and Benjamin Peloquin and Juan Pino and Jovan Popovic and Omid Poursaeed and Fabian Prada and Alice Rakotoarison and Rakesh Ranjan and Alexander Richard and Christophe Ropers and Safiyyah Saleem and Vasu Sharma and Alex Shcherbyna and Jia Shen and Jie Shen and Anastasis Stathopoulos and Anna Sun and Paden Tomasello and Tuan Tran and Arina Turkatenko and Bo Wan and Chao Wang and Jeff Wang and Mary Williamson and Carleigh Wood and Tao Xiang and Yilin Yang and Julien Yao and Chen Zhang and Jiemin Zhang and Xinyue Zhang and Jason Zheng and Pavlo Zhyzheria and Jan Zikes and Michael Zollhoefer},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {arXiv:2506.22554 [cs.CV]}\n}</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-card\" data-key=\"creswell2025\">\n<div class=\"pub-title\">\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026251333784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Effects of Alcohol in Groups of Heavy-Drinking Young Adults: A Multimodal Investigation of Alcohol Responses in a Laboratory Social Setting</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-meta\">\nCreswell, Wright, Sayette, Girard, Lyons & Smyth\n<br/>\n<em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-actions\">\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"abstract\" role=\"button\">Abstract</a>\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"citation\" role=\"button\">Citation</a>\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"bib\" role=\"button\">BibTeX</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"toggle-area\" data-current=\"\">\n<button class=\"copy-btn\">Copy</button>\n<span class=\"copy-toast\">Copied!</span>\n<div class=\"panel-label\">—</div>\n<div class=\"content\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:none;\">\n<div class=\"payload-abstract\">Young adults typically drink socially, yet most lab studies testing alcohol responses have administered alcohol in isolation. This is the first study to examine alcohol responses and social reward in a group setting among a young-adult at-risk sample. Heavy-drinking young adults (N = 393; 50\\% female) were grouped in threes and drank a moderate dose of alcohol or a placebo beverage. These social interactions were recorded, and the duration and sequence of facial expressions, speech, and laughter were coded. Results revealed a comprehensive, multimodal, positive effect of alcohol on socioemotional experiences across self-report (e.g., increased positive affect and social bonding, greater relief of unpleasant feelings) and behavioral outcomes at both the individual (e.g., more rapid increases in Duchenne smiling) and group levels (e.g., more three-way conversations).

Due to their strong reinforcing properties, HPF are hypothesized to lead to greater energy intake within a meal. However, this premise has not been tested in free-living conditions. The current study examined the association between within-meal HPF intake and 1) measured energy intake and 2) self-reported overeating, assessed within eating occasions using smartphone-based food photography methodology. Methods A total of 29 participants reported food intake and eating experiences (N=345 total eating occasions) in real-time for 4~days using smartphone-based food photography methodology. HPF were identified using a standardized definition. Bayesian multilevel modeling was conducted to investigate the within-person effects of proportional calorie intake from HPF (\\%kcal from HPF) on total energy intake and subjective overeating. Pre-meal hunger and proportional energy intake from high energy dense (HED) foods were included as covariates. Results Results revealed that when participants consumed more \\%kcal from HPF than their average, they consumed greater total energy during eating occasions, even when controlling for pre-meal hunger and \\%kcal from HED foods (median {$\\beta~$}=~0.09, 95\\% HDI [0.02, 0.16], pd.~=~99.56\\%). Additionally, consuming more \\%kcal from HPF than average was associated with greater eating despite feeling full, when controlling covariates (median {$\\beta~$}=~0.15, 95\\% HDI [-0.02, 0.34], pd~=~96.45\\%). Conclusions The findings supported the premise that HPF themselves may yield greater energy intake and eating despite satiation, measured in real-time and free-living conditions.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{jun2025,\n  title = {The Role of Hyper-Palatable Foods in Energy Intake Measured Using Mobile Food Photography Methodology},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Jeffrey M.

This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, utilizing clinical ratings collected from patients with either affective or nonaffective psychoses ( n = 1,042). Drawing from established clinical instruments, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Montgomery-{\\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale, a broad spectrum of core psychotic symptoms was considered for the model development. Among the candidate models considered, including correlated factors and multifactor models, a model with seven correlated factors encompassing positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, mania, disorganization, hostility, and anxiety was most interpretable with acceptable fit. The seven factors exhibited expected associations with external validators, were replicable through cross-validation, and were generalizable across affective and nonaffective psychoses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) The aim of this study is to formulate a transdiagnostic dimensional model by integrating well-established clinical ratings that encompass a wide range of core symptoms observed in both affective and nonaffective psychoses. We demonstrate that a multidimensional symptom model representing both psychotic (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and disorganization) and mood symptoms (depression, mania, hostility, and anxiety) is most interpretable and applicable across psychotic diagnoses. Considering the complex interrelationships among identified symptom dimensions, a dimensional approach may be more suitable for characterizing the symptom profiles of psychotic patients than a categorical diagnostic approach.

Some of this information is structured, while some is unstructured. Yet most studies of multiattribute decisions focus on decisions made from structured information. This study evaluated how structured and unstructured information is used within graduate admissions decisions. We examined a uniquely comprehensive data set of N = 2,231 graduate applications to the University of Kansas, containing full application packages, demographics, and final admissions decisions for each applicant. To make sense of our documents, we applied structural topic modeling (STM), a topic model that allows topic content and prevalence to covary based on other metadata (e.g., department of study). STM allowed us to examine what information the letters and statements contain and the relationships between variables like gender and race and the textual information. We found that most topics in the unstructured data related to specific fields of study. The STMs did not uncover strong differences among applicants regarding race and gender, though the recommendation letters and personal statements for international applicants did show some different topic profiles than domestic applicants. We also found that admissions decision makers behaved as if they prioritized structured numeric metrics, using unstructured information to check for disqualifications, if at all. However, we found that topics were less reliable than admissions documents, meaning that additional ways of using them cannot be completely ruled out. The implications of our findings on graduate admissions decisions are discussed.

Research is needed to understand mechanisms of change during imaginal exposure for EDs, including whether within- and between-session distress reduction is related to treatment outcomes. Method Study 1 tested four sessions of online imaginal exposure (N~=~143). Study 2 examined combined imaginal and in vivo exposure, comprising six imaginal exposure sessions (N~=~26). ED symptoms and fears were assessed pre- and posttreatment, and subjective distress and state anxiety were collected during sessions. Results Subjective distress tended to increase within-session in both studies, and within-session reduction was not associated with change in ED symptoms or fears. In Study 1, between-session reduction of distress and state anxiety was associated with greater decreases in ED symptoms and fears pre-to posttreatment. In Study 2, between-session distress reduction occurred but was not related to outcomes. Conclusions Within-session distress reduction may not promote change during exposure for EDs, whereas between-session distress reduction may be associated with better treatment outcomes. These findings corroborate research on distress reduction during exposure for anxiety disorders. Clinicians might consider approaches to exposure-based treatment that focus on distress tolerance and promote between-session distress reduction.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{butler2024,\n  title = {Are Within- and between-Session Changes in Distress Associated with Treatment Outcomes? {{Findings}} from Two Clinical Trials of Exposure for Eating Disorders},\n  author = {Rachel M.

Linking PTSD symptoms to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology may enable researchers and clinicians to understand the patterns and breadth of behavioral sequelae following traumatic experiences that may be shared with other psychiatric disorders. To explore this premise, we recruited a trauma-exposed online community sample (N = 462) and measured dimensional transdiagnostic traits of psychopathology using parceled facets derived from the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Faceted--Short Form. PTSD symptom factors were measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and derived using confirmatory factor analysis according to the seven-factor hybrid model (i.e., Intrusions, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, Anxious Arousal, And Dysphoric Arousal). We observed hypothesized associations between PTSD factors and transdiagnostic traits indicating that some transdiagnostic dimensions were associated with nearly all PTSD symptom factors (e.g., emotional lability: rmean = .35), whereas others showed more unique relationships (e.g., hostility--Externalizing Behavior: r = .60; hostility with other PTSD factors: rs = .12--.31). All PTSD factors were correlated with traits beyond those that would appear to be construct-relevant, suggesting the possibility of indirect associations that should be explicated in future research. The results indicate the breadth of trait-like consequences associated with PTSD symptom exacerbation, with implications for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Although PTSD is not a personality disorder, the findings indicate that increased PTSD factor severity is moderately associated with different patterns of trait-like disruptions in many areas of functioning.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{sprunger2024,\n  title = {Associations between Transdiagnostic Traits of Psychopathology and Hybrid Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Factors in a Trauma-Exposed Community Sample},\n  author = {Joel G.

Two types of contextual cues are of particular interest: (1) individual factors of the interlocutors, such as their demographic attributes, and (2) situational factors, like the outcome of a preceding event. To facilitate their study, we introduce the GeSTICS Dataset, a novel multimodal corpus comprising 9,853 questions and 10,460 answers from audiovisual recordings of post-game sports interviews by 147 interviewees. The dataset contains speech data, including textual transcriptions, lexical descriptors, and acoustic features, as well as visual data encompassing the interviewee's body pose and facial expressions, with an emphasis on capturing these modalities during both the question-listening and answering phases of the interview. Furthermore, GeSTICS incorporates metadata about individual factors, such as the age and cultural background of the interviewees, and situational factors, like the results of the games, which are often overlooked in existing multimodal datasets. Our preliminary analysis of GeSTICS reveals that the effects of speech features, such as loudness and lexical choice, on the production of co-speech gestures in both speaking and listening phases are moderated by situational factors and the interviewee's individual factors.

However, it remains unclear whether types of environmental reinforcement (e.g., social or work) may differentially influence use. This study tested the association between types of environmental reinforcement and engagement in multiple health risk behaviors (alcohol use, binge eating, and nicotine use). Cross-sectional data were collected from a general population sample of US adults (N = 596). The Pleasant Events Schedule (PES) was used to measure sources of reinforcement. Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) characterized different areas of environmental reinforcement and correlations with alcohol consumption, binge eating, and nicotine use. A four-factor structure of the PES demonstrated a conceptually cohesive model with acceptable fit and partial strict invariance. Social-related reinforcement was positively associated with alcohol consumption ({$\\beta$} = 0.30, p {$&lt;$} 0.001) and binge eating ({$\\beta$} = 0.26, p {$&lt;$} 0.001). Work/school-related reinforcement was negatively associated with binge eating ({$\\beta$} = -0.14, p = 0.006). No areas of reinforcement were significantly associated with nicotine use (p values = 0.069 to 0.755). Social-related activities may be associated with engagement in multiple health risk behaviors (more binge eating and alcohol use), whereas work/school-related activities may be preventative against binge eating. Understanding these relationships can inform prevention efforts targeting health risk behaviors.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{linsalata2024,\n  title = {Sources of Environmental Reinforcement and Engagement in Health Risk Behaviors among a General Population Sample of {{US}} Adults},\n  author = {Alexa M.

In contrast to previous work in Affective Computing, which pursued a single ``ground truth'' label for the affective content of each moment of each video (e.g., by averaging the ratings of 2 to 7 trained participants), we embrace the subjectivity inherent to emotional experiences and provide the full distribution of all participants' ratings (with an average of 76.7 raters per video). We argue that this choice represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock new research directions, generate new hypotheses, and inspire novel methods in the Affective Computing community. We also describe several interdisciplinary use cases for the database: to provide dynamic norms for emotion elicitation studies (e.g., in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience), to train and test affective content analysis algorithms (e.g., for dynamic emotion recognition, video summarization, and movie recommendation), and to study subjectivity in emotional reactions (e.g., to identify moments of emotional ambiguity or ambivalence within movies, identify predictors of subjectivity, and develop personalized affective content analysis algorithms).

However, less is known about the conditions under which the dynamic advantage occurs. The aim of this research was to test emotion recognition in static and dynamic facial expressions, thereby exploring the role of three featural parameters (prototypicality, ambiguity and complexity) in human and machine analysis. In two studies, facial expression videos and corresponding images depicting the peak of the target and non-target emotion were presented to human observers and the machine classifier (FACET). Results revealed higher recognition rates for dynamic stimuli compared to non-target images. Such benefit disappeared in the context of target-emotion images which were similarly well (or even better) recognised than videos, and more prototypical, less ambiguous, and more complex in appearance than non-target images. While prototypicality and ambiguity exerted more predictive power in machine performance, complexity was more indicative of human emotion recognition. Interestingly, recognition performance by the machine was found to be superior to humans for both target and non-target images. Together, the findings point towards a compensatory role of dynamic information, particularly when static-based stimuli lack relevant features of the target emotion. Implications for research using automatic facial expression analysis (AFEA) are discussed.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{kim2023,\n  title = {Human and Machine Recognition of Dynamic and Static Facial Expressions: Prototypicality, Ambiguity, and Complexity},\n  author = {Hyunwoo Kim and Dennis K{\\\"u}ster and Jeffrey M.

This is especially important in certain applications, such as psychotherapy, where individualized tracking of behavior patterns can provide valuable information about the patient's mental state. Conventional methods that rely on aggregate statistics and correlational metrics may not always suffice, as they are often unable to capture causal relationships or evaluate the true probability of identified patterns. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach to learning multimodal and interpersonal representations of behavior dynamics during one-on-one interaction. Our approach is enabled by the introduction of a multiview extension of latent change score models, which facilitates the concurrent capture of both inter-modal and interpersonal behavior dynamics and the identification of directional relationships between them. A core advantage of our approach is its high level of interpretability while simultaneously achieving strong predictive performance. We evaluate our approach within the domain of therapist-client interactions, with the objective of gaining a deeper understanding about the collaborative relationship between the two, a crucial element of the therapeutic process. Our results demonstrate improved performance over conventional approaches that rely upon summary statistics or correlational metrics. Furthermore, since our multiview approach includes the explicit modeling of uncertainty, it naturally lends itself to integration with probabilistic classifiers, such as Gaussian process models. We demonstrate that this integration leads to even further improved performance, all the while maintaining highly interpretable qualities. Our analysis provides compelling motivation for further exploration of stochastic systems within computational models of behavior.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{vail2023,\n  title = {Representation Learning for Interpersonal and Multimodal Behavior Dynamics: A Multiview Extension of Latent Change Score Models},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Alexandria K.

Methods Behavioral data was collected across 99 sessions from 38 participants recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit. Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical ``clinical rounds'' encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Analysis We quantified aspects of participants' verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants' PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures. Results Our predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains. Conclusion Our interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2022,\n  title = {Computational Analysis of Spoken Language in Acute Psychosis and Mania},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

The working alliance is a multifaceted concept capturing the collaborative aspect of the therapist-client relationship; a strong working alliance has been extensively linked to many positive therapeutic outcomes. Although therapy sessions are decidedly multimodal interactions, the language modality is of particular interest given its recognized relationship to similar dyadic concepts such as rapport, cooperation, and affiliation. Specifically, in this work we study language entrainment, which measures how much the therapist and client adapt toward each other's use of language over time. Despite the growing body of work in this area, however, relatively few studies examine causal relationships between human behavior and these relationship metrics: does an individual's perception of their partner affect how they speak, or does how they speak affect their perception? We explore these questions in this work through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, which allow for both multilevel and temporal modeling of the relationship between the quality of the therapist-client working alliance and the participants' language entrainment. In our first experiment, we demonstrate that these techniques perform well in comparison to other common machine learning models, with the added benefits of interpretability and causal analysis. In our second analysis, we interpret the learned models to examine the relationship between working alliance and language entrainment and address our exploratory research questions. The results reveal that a therapist's language entrainment can have a significant impact on the client's perception of the working alliance, and that the client's language entrainment is a strong indicator of their perception of the working alliance. We discuss the implications of these results and consider several directions for future work in multimodality.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{vail2022,\n  title = {Toward Causal Understanding of Therapist-Client Relationships: A Study of Language Modality and Social Entrainment},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Alexandria K Vail and Jeffrey M Girard and Lauren M Bylsma and Jeffrey F Cohn and Jay Fournier and Holly A Swartz and Louis-Philippe Morency},\n  year = {2022},\n  pages = {487--494},\n  address = {Bengaluru, India},\n  doi = {10/gt3bwj}\n}</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-card\" data-key=\"vanoest2022\">\n<div class=\"pub-title\">\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weighting Schemes and Incomplete Data: A Generalized Bayesian Framework for Chance-Corrected Interrater Agreement</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-meta\">\nvan Oest & Girard\n<br/>\n<em>Psychological Methods</em>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pub-actions\">\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"abstract\" role=\"button\">Abstract</a>\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"citation\" role=\"button\">Citation</a>\n<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"bib\" role=\"button\">BibTeX</a>\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/s5n4e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Preprint</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"toggle-area\" data-current=\"\">\n<button class=\"copy-btn\">Copy</button>\n<span class=\"copy-toast\">Copied!</span>\n<div class=\"panel-label\">—</div>\n<div class=\"content\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:none;\">\n<div class=\"payload-abstract\">Van Oest (2019) developed a framework to assess interrater agreement for nominal categories and complete data. We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chance-corrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S-coefficient, Scott's pi, Fleiss' kappa, and Van Oest's uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott's pi and Fleiss' kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient often performs much better than the S-coefficient, but the S-coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement.

To assess whether the results are reproducible, it is good practice to let two or more raters independently classify the items, compute the proportion of pairwise rater agreement, and adjust for agreement expected by chance. Most chance-corrected agreement coefficients assume nominal categories and include only full agreements in which raters choose the same category. However, many situations (e.g., point scales) imply ordinal categories, where raters may receive partial credit for disagreements, based on the distance of their chosen categories and captured by a weighting scheme. Furthermore, raters often classify only subsets of items, where the missing data occur either by accident or by design. The present study develops a framework to estimate chance-corrected agreement for all four combinations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The resulting coefficient requires only a few lines of programming code and captures several existing coefficients via different values of its input parameters; it augments all nested coefficients with a weighting scheme and the option of missing item classifications. We use simulation to compare the coefficient performances for different weighting schemes, missing data mechanisms, and category proportions: The so-called uniform prior coefficient often (but not always) performs best.

Yet, no study to date has examined the longitudinal associations between relationship quality in family/peer domains and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth with BD. Thus, we investigated how between-person differences -- reflecting the average relationship quality across time -- and within-person changes, reflecting recent fluctuations in relationship quality, act as distal and/or proximal risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts. Methods We used longitudinal data from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth Study (N = 413). Relationship quality variables were decomposed into stable (i.e., average) and varying (i.e., recent) components and entered, along with major clinical covariates, into separate Bayesian multilevel models predicting SI and suicide attempt. We also examined how the relationship quality effects interacted with age and sex. Results Poorer average relationship quality with parents ({$\\beta$} = -.33, 95\\% Bayesian highest density interval (HDI) [-0.54, -0.11]) or friends ({$\\beta$} = -.33, 95\\% HDI [-0.55, -0.11]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI but not suicide attempt. Worsening recent relationship quality with parents ({$\\beta$} = -.10, 95\\% HDI [-0.19, -0.03]) and, to a lesser extent, friends ({$\\beta$} = -.06, 95\\% HDI [-0.15, 0.03]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI, but only worsening recent relationship quality with parents was also associated with increased risk of suicide attempt ({$\\beta$} = -.15, 95\\% HDI [-0.31, 0.01]). The effects of certain relationship quality variables were moderated by gender but not age. Conclusions Among youth with BD, having poorer average relationship quality with peers and/or parents represents a distal risk factor for SI but not suicide attempts. Additionally, worsening recent relationship quality with parents may be a time-sensitive indicator of increased risk for SI or suicide attempt.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{sewall2021,\n  title = {A {{Bayesian}} Multilevel Analysis of the Longitudinal Associations between Relationship Quality and Suicidal Ideation and Attempts among Youth with Bipolar Disorder},\n  author = {Craig J.

Clients may terminate therapy for various reasons, but one of the most common causes is the lack of a strong working alliance. The concept of working alliance captures the collaborative relationship between a client and their therapist when working toward the progress and recovery of the client seeking treatment. Unfortunately, clients are often unwilling to directly express dissatisfaction in care until they have already decided to terminate therapy. On the other side, therapists may miss subtle signs of client discontent during treatment before it is too late. In this work, we demonstrate that nonverbal behavior analysis may aid in bridging this gap. The present study focuses primarily on the head gestures of both the client and therapist, contextualized within conversational turn-taking actions between the pair during psychotherapy sessions. We identify multiple behavior patterns suggestive of an individual's perspective on the working alliance; interestingly, these patterns also differ between the client and the therapist. These patterns inform the development of predictive models for self-reported ratings of working alliance, which demonstrate significant predictive power for both client and therapist ratings. Future applications of such models may stimulate preemptive intervention to strengthen a weak working alliance, whether explicitly attempting to repair the existing alliance or establishing a more suitable client-therapist pairing, to ensure that clients encounter fewer barriers to receiving the treatment they need.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{vail2021,\n  title = {Goals, Tasks, and Bonds: Toward the Computational Assessment of Therapist versus Client Perception of Working Alliance},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Alexandria K.

One of the top research priorities has been to identify factors affecting perceptions of physical attractiveness (PPA). Recent work suggests PPA derives from different sources (e.g., target, perceiver, stimulus type). Although smiles in particular are believed to enhance PPA, support has been surprisingly limited. This study comprehensively examines the effect of smiles on PPA and, more broadly, evaluates the roles of target, perceiver, and stimulus type in PPA variation. Perceivers (n\\,=\\,181) rated both static images and 5-s videos of targets displaying smiling and neutral-expressions. Smiling images were rated as more attractive than neutral-expression images (regardless of stimulus motion format). Interestingly, perceptions of physical attractiveness were based more on the perceiver than on either the target or format in which the target was presented. Results clarify the effect of smiles, and highlight the significant role of the perceiver, in PPA.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{bowdring2021,\n  title = {In the Eye of the Beholder: A Comprehensive Analysis of Stimulus Type, Perceiver, and Target in Physical Attractiveness Perceptions},\n  author = {Molly A.

The principal exemplar of this view is the Duchenne smile, a configuration of facial-muscle movements (i.e., smiling with eye constriction) that has been argued to reliably reveal genuine positive emotion. In this paper, we formalized a list of hypotheses that have been proposed regarding the Duchenne smile, briefly reviewed the literature weighing on these hypotheses, identified limitations and unanswered questions, and conducted two empirical studies to begin addressing these limitations and answering these questions. Both studies analyzed a database of 751 smiles observed while 136 participants completed experimental tasks designed to elicit amusement, embarrassment, fear, and physical pain. Study 1 focused on participants' self-reported positive emotion and Study 2 focused on how third-party observers would perceive videos of these smiles. Most of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the Duchenne smile were either contradicted by or only weakly supported by our data. Eye constriction did provide some information about experienced positive emotion, but this information was lacking in specificity, already provided by other smile characteristics, and highly dependent on context. Eye constriction provided more information about perceived positive emotion, including some unique information over other smile characteristics, but context was also important here as well. Overall, our results suggest that accurately inferring positive emotion from a smile requires more sophisticated methods than simply looking for the presence/absence (or even the intensity) of eye constriction.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2021,\n  title = {Reconsidering the {{Duchenne}} Smile: Formalizing and Testing Hypotheses about Eye Constriction and Positive Emotion},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

The subjective evaluation of artificial human-like behaviour in embodied conversational agents is however expensive and little is known about the quality of the data it returns. Two approaches to subjective evaluation can be largely distinguished, one relying on ratings, the other on pairwise comparisons. In this study we use co-speech gestures to compare the two against each other and answer questions about their appropriateness for evaluation of artificial behaviour. We consider their ability to rate quality, but also aspects pertaining to the effort of use and the time required to collect subjective data. We use crowd sourcing to rate the quality of co-speech gestures in avatars, assessing which method picks up more detail in subjective assessments. We compared gestures generated by three different machine learning models with various level of behavioural quality. We found that both approaches were able to rank the videos according to quality and that the ranking significantly correlated, showing that in terms of quality there is no preference of one method over the other. We also found that pairwise comparisons were slightly faster and came with improved inter-rater reliability, suggesting that for small-scale studies pairwise comparisons are to be favoured over ratings.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{wolfert2021,\n  title = {To Rate or Not to Rate: Investigating Evaluation Methods for Generated Co-Speech Gestures},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Multimodal Interaction}}},\n  author = {Pieter Wolfert and Jeffrey M.

Much less studied, however, is expressiveness---the extent to which someone shows any feeling or emotion. Expressiveness is related to personality and mental health and plays a crucial role in social interaction. As such, the ability to automatically detect or predict expressiveness can facilitate significant advancements in areas ranging from psychiatric care to artificial social intelligence. Motivated by these potential applications, we present an extension of the BP4D+ dataset (Zhang et al. 2016) with human ratings of expressiveness and develop methods for (1) automatically predicting expressiveness from visual data and (2) defining relationships between interpretable visual signals and expressiveness. In addition, we study the emotional context in which expressiveness occurs and hypothesize that different sets of signals are indicative of expressiveness in different contexts (e.g., in response to surprise or in response to pain). Analysis of our statistical models confirms our hypothesis. Consequently, by looking at expressiveness separately in distinct emotional contexts, our predictive models show significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to human performance in terms of correlation with the ground truth.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{lin2020c,\n  title = {Context-Dependent Models for Predicting and Characterizing Facial Expressiveness},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd {{Workshop}} on {{Affective Content Analysis}} Co-Located with the 34th {{AAAI Conference}} on {{Artificial Intelligence}}},\n  author = {Victoria Lin and Jeffrey M.

This method has significant promise for assessing dynamic interpersonal processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of individual sex, dyadic familiarity, and situational conflict on patterns of interpersonal warmth, dominance, and complementarity as assessed via CAID. We used six samples with 603 dyads, including two samples of unacquainted mixed-sex undergraduates interacting in a collaborative task, two samples of couples interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks, and two samples of mothers and children interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks. Complementarity effects were robust across all samples, and individuals tended to be relatively warm and dominant. Results from multilevel models indicated that women were slightly warmer than men, whereas there were no sex differences in dominance. Unfamiliar dyads and dyads interacting in more collaborative tasks were relatively warmer, more submissive, and more complementary on warmth but less complementary on dominance. These findings speak to the utility of the CAID method for assessing interpersonal dynamics and provide norms for researchers who use the method for different types of samples and applications.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{hopwood2020,\n  title = {Properties of the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics across Sex, Level of Familiarity, and Interpersonal Conflict},\n  author = {Christopher J.

Due to the close relationship between emotional expressiveness and behavioral health, as well as the crucial role that it plays in social interaction, the ability to automatically predict emotional expressiveness stands to spur advances in science, medicine, and industry. In this paper, we explore three related research questions. First, how well can emotional expressiveness be predicted from visual, linguistic, and multimodal behavioral signals? Second, how important is each behavioral modality to the prediction of emotional expressiveness? Third, which behavioral signals are reliably related to emotional expressiveness? To answer these questions, we add highly reliable transcripts and human ratings of perceived emotional expressiveness to an existing video database and use this data to train, validate, and test predictive models. Our best model shows promising predictive performance on this dataset ({\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend} = 0.65, {\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}2 = 0.45, {\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend}{\\dbend} = 0.74). Multimodal models tend to perform best overall, and models trained on the linguistic modality tend to outperform models trained on the visual modality.

This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to quantify in vivo daily patterns of social interaction in adults as a function of demographic and clinical factors. Method Adults with and without ASD (NASD\\,=\\,23, NNeurotypical\\,=\\,52) were trained in an EMA protocol to report their social interactions via smartphone over one week. Participants completed measures of IQ, ASD symptom severity and alexithymia symptom severity. Results Cyclical multilevel models were used to account for nesting of observations. Results suggest a daily cyclical pattern of social interaction that was robust to ASD and alexithymia symptoms. Adults with ASD did not have fewer social interactions than neurotypical peers; however, severity of alexithymia symptoms predicted fewer social interactions regardless of ASD status. Conclusions These findings suggest that alexithymia, not ASD severity, may drive social isolation and highlight the need to reevaluate previously accepted notions regarding differences in social behavior utilizing modern methods.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{gerber2019,\n  title = {Alexithymia -- Not Autism -- Is Associated with Frequency of Social Interactions in Adults},\n  author = {Alan H.

These tools present a valuable, but largely untapped, opportunity for social scientists to perform observational analyses of nonverbal behavior at very large scale. Various tech companies are collecting huge corpora of images and videos from around the world that could be used to study important scientific questions. However, privacy restrictions and intellectual property concerns render these data inaccessible to most academics. Unfortunately, this limits the potential for scientific advancement and leads to the consolidation of data and opportunity into the hands of a few powerful institutions. In this paper, we ask whether similar psychological insights can be gained by analyzing smaller, public datasets that are more within reach for academic researchers. As a proof-of-concept for this idea, we gather, analyze, and release a corpus of public images and metadata and use it to replicate recent psychological findings about smiling, gender, and culture. In so doing, we provide evidence that psychological insights can indeed by democratized through the automated analysis of nonverbal behavior.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{mcduff2019,\n  title = {Democratizing Psychological Insights from Analysis of Nonverbal Behavior},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th {{International Conference}} on {{Affective Computing}} and {{Intelligent Interaction}} ({{ACII}})},\n  author = {Daniel McDuff and Jeffrey M.

Two undergraduate samples (Sample 1: N = 290; Sample 2: N = 188) completed self-report measures of interpersonal processes based in the interpersonal circumplex (IPC), as well as measures of related constructs. In examining IPC correlates, the authors used a novel bootstrapping approach to determine if admiration and rivalry related to differing interpersonal profiles. Consistent with the authors' hypotheses, admiration was distinctly related to generally agentic (i.e., dominant) interpersonal processes, whereas rivalry generally reflected (low) communal (i.e., hostile) interpersonal processes. Furthermore, NARQ-admiration and NARQ-rivalry related to generally adaptive and maladaptive aspects of status-related constructs, emotional, personality, and social adjustment, respectively. This research provides further support for the NARC, as well as construct validation for the NARQ.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{grove2019,\n  title = {Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry: An Interpersonal Approach to Construct Validation},\n  author = {Jeremy L.

This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{girard2019,\n  title = {Reconsidering the Duchenne Smile: Indicator of Positive Emotion or Artifact of Smile Intensity?},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th {{International Conference}} on {{Affective Computing}} and {{Intelligent Interaction}} ({{ACII}})},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms) exacerbate and cooccur with chronic pain. Yet no study has prospectively considered the associations among these psychological processes and pain reports using experience sampling methods (ESMs) during the acute aftermath of injury. This study applied ESM via daily text messaging to monitor and detect relationships among psychosocial factors and postinjury pain across the first 14 days after emergency department (ED) discharge. Methods We recruited 75 adults (59\\% male; mean {\\textpm} SD age = 34 {\\textpm} 11.73 years) who experienced a potentially traumatic injury (i.e., involving life threat or serious injury) in the past 24 hours from the EDs of two Level I trauma centers. Participants received five questions per day via text messaging from Day 1 to Day 14 post--ED discharge; three questions measured PTSD symptoms, one question measured perceived social support, and one question measured physical pain. Results Sixty-seven participants provided sufficient data for inclusion in the final analyses, and the average response rate per subject was 86\\%. Pain severity score decreased from a mean {\\textpm} SD of 7.2 {\\textpm} 2.0 to 4.4 {\\textpm} 2.69 over 14 days and 50\\% of the variance in daily pain scores was within person. In multilevel structural equation models, pain scores decreased over time, and daily fluctuations of hyperarousal (B = 0.22, 95\\% confidetnce interval = 0.08--0.36) were uniquely associated with daily fluctuations in reported pain level within each person. Conclusions Daily hyperarousal symptoms predict same-day pain severity over the acute postinjury recovery period. We also demonstrated feasibility to screen and identify patients at risk for pain chronicity in the acute aftermath of injury. Early interventions aimed at addressing hyperarousal (e.g., anxiolytics) could potentially aid in reducing experience of pain.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{pacella2018,\n  title = {The Association between Daily Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Pain over the First 14 Days after Injury: {{An}} Experience Sampling Study},\n  author = {Maria L.

However, despite progress in new approaches as well as benchmarking efforts, most evaluations still focus on either posed expressions, near-frontal recordings, or both. This makes it hard to tell how existing expression recognition approaches perform under conditions where faces appear in a wide range of poses (or camera views), displaying ecologically valid expressions. The main obstacle for assessing this is the availability of suitable data, and the challenge proposed here addresses this limitation. The FG 2017 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017) extends FERA 2015 to the estimation of Action Units occurrence and intensity under different camera views. In this paper we present the third challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2017, in Washington, United States. Two sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, and the estimation of AU intensity. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for both sub-challenges.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{valstar2017,\n  title = {{{FERA}} 2017 - Addressing Head Pose in the Third Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis Challenge},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 12th {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Michel F Valstar and Enrique Sanchez-Lozano and Jeffrey F.

Due to thehigh cost of traditional observational methods, the relationshipbetween culture and facial behavior is not well-understood. Inthe current study, we explored the sociocultural factors that influencefacial behavior using large-scale observational analyses.We developed and implemented an algorithm to automaticallyanalyze the smiling of 866,726 participants across 31 differentcountries. We found that participants smiled more when from acountry that is higher in individualism, has a lower populationdensity, and has a long history of immigration diversity (i.e.,historical heterogeneity). Our findings provide the first evidencethat historical heterogeneity predicts actual smiling behavior.Furthermore, they converge with previous findings using selfreportmethods.

We built a structural model of mental disorders including factors corresponding to detachment (avoidant personality, social phobia, major depression), internalizing (dependent personality, borderline personality, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress, major depression), disinhibition (antisocial personality, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, borderline personality), dominance (histrionic personality, narcissistic personality, paranoid personality), and compulsivity (obsessive-compulsive personality). All dimensions showed good interpersonal prototypicality (e.g., detachment was defined by a socially avoidant/nonassertive interpersonal profile) except for internalizing, which was diffusely associated with elevated interpersonal distress. The findings for individual disorders were largely consistent with the dimension that each disorder loaded on, with the exception of the internalizing and dominance disorders, which were interpersonally heterogeneous. These results replicate previous findings and provide novel insights into social dysfunction in psychopathology by wedding the power of hierarchical (i.e., dimensional) modeling and interpersonal circumplex assessment.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2017,\n  title = {Interpersonal Problems across Levels of the Psychopathology Hierarchy},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

However, observational studies of actual patterns of facial behavior have been rare and typically limited to the analysis of dozens of participants from two or three regions. We present the first large-scale evidence of cultural differences in observed facial behavior, including 740,984 participants from 12 countries around the world. We used an Internet-based framework to collect video data of participants in two different settings: in their homes and in market research facilities. Using computer vision algorithms designed for this data set, we measured smiling and brow furrowing expressions as participants watched television ads. Our results reveal novel findings and provide empirical evidence to support theories about cultural and gender differences in display rules. Participants from more individualist cultures displayed more brow furrowing overall, whereas smiling depended on both culture and setting. Specifically, participants from more individualist countries were more expressive in the facility setting, while participants from more collectivist countries were more expressive in the home setting. Female participants displayed more smiling and less brow furrowing than male participants overall, with the latter difference being more pronounced in more individualist countries. This is the first study to leverage advances in computer science to enable large-scale observational research that would not have been possible using traditional methods</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{mcduff2017a,\n  title = {Large-Scale Observational Evidence of Cross-Cultural Differences in Facial Behavior},\n  author = {Daniel McDuff and Jeffrey M.

Relationship science has identified the study of dyadic behavioral patterns between couple members during conflict as an important window in to relational functioning with both short-term and long-term consequences. Several methods have been developed for the momentary assessment of behavior during interpersonal transactions. Among these, the most popular is the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), which organizes social behavior into a set of discrete behavioral constructs. This study examines the interpersonal meaning of the SPAFF codes through the lens of interpersonal theory, which uses the fundamental dimensions of Dominance and Affiliation to organize interpersonal behavior. A sample of 67 couples completed a conflict task, which was video recorded and coded using SPAFF and a method for rating momentary interpersonal behavior, the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID). Actor partner interdependence models in a multilevel structural equation modeling framework were used to study the covariation of SPAFF codes and CAID ratings. Results showed that a number of SPAFF codes had clear interpersonal signatures, but many did not. Additionally, actor and partner effects for the same codes were strongly consistent with interpersonal theory's principle of complementarity. Thus, findings reveal points of convergence and divergence in the 2 systems and provide support for central tenets of interpersonal theory. Future directions based on these initial findings are discussed.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{ross2017,\n  title = {Momentary Patterns of Covariation between Specific Affects and Interpersonal Behavior: {{Linking}} Relationship Science and Personality Assessment},\n  author = {Jaclyn M.

While much progress has been made toward the automatic detection of facial expression occurrence, controversy exists about how to estimate expression intensity. The most straight-forward approach is to train multiclass or regression models using intensity ground truth. However, collecting intensity ground truth is even more time consuming and expensive than collecting binary ground truth. As a shortcut, some researchers have proposed using the decision values of binary-trained maximum margin classifiers as a proxy for expression intensity. We provide empirical evidence that this heuristic is flawed in practice as well as in theory. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts when it comes to estimating smile intensity: researchers must take the time to collect and train on intensity ground truth. However, if they do so, high reliability with expert human coders can be achieved. Intensity-trained multiclass and regression models outperformed binary-trained classifier decision values on smile intensity estimation across multiple databases and methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Multiclass models even outperformed binary-trained classifiers on smile occurrence detection.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2015,\n  title = {Estimating Smile Intensity: A Better Way},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

One of the challenges that is actively being addressed is the automatic estimation of expression intensities. To continue to provide a standardisation platform and to help the field progress beyond its current limitations, the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015) will challenge participants to estimate FACS Action Unit (AU) intensity as well as AU occurrence on a common benchmark dataset with reliable manual annotations. Evaluation will be done using a clear and well-defined protocol. In this paper we present the second such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 11 IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2015, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Three sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, the estimation of AU intensity for pre-segmented data, and fully automatic AU intensity estimation. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for the three sub-challenges.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{valstar2015,\n  title = {{{FERA}} 2015 - Second Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis Challenge},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Michel F.

Digital video and expert coding of spontaneous facial activity from 80 subjects (over 350,000 frames) were used to train and test support vector machine classifiers. Appearance features were shape-normalized SIFT descriptors and shape features were 66 facial landmarks. Ten-fold cross-validation was used in all evaluations. Number of subjects and number of frames per subject differentially affected appearance and shape-based classifiers. For appearance features, which are high-dimensional, increasing the number of training subjects from 8 to 64 incrementally improved performance, regardless of the number of frames taken from each subject (ranging from 450 through 3600). In contrast, for shape features, increases in the number of training subjects and frames were associated with mixed results. In summary, maximal performance was attained using appearance features from large numbers of subjects with as few as 450 frames per subject. These findings suggest that variation in the number of subjects rather than number of frames per subject yields most efficient performance.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{girard2015b,\n  title = {How Much Training Data for Facial Action Unit Detection?},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automatic Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Surveys suggest that social processes underlie sex differences in drinking patterns, with men reporting greater social enhancement from alcohol than women, and all-male social drinking contexts being associated with particularly high rates of hazardous drinking. But experimental evidence for sex differences in social-emotional response to alcohol has heretofore been lacking. Research using larger sample sizes, a social context, and more sensitive measures of alcohol's rewarding effects may be necessary to better understand sex differences in the etiology of AUD. This study explored the acute effects of alcohol during social exchange on speech volume---an objective measure of social-emotional experience that was reliably captured at the group level. Social drinkers (360 male; 360 female) consumed alcohol (.82 g/kg males; .74 g/kg females), placebo, or a no-alcohol control beverage in groups of 3 over 36-min. Within each of the 3 beverage conditions, equal numbers of groups consisted of all males, all females, 2 females and 1 male, and 1 female and 2 males. Speech volume was monitored continuously throughout the drink period, and group volume emerged as a robust correlate of self-report and facial indexes of social reward. Notably, alcohol-related increases in group volume were observed selectively in all-male groups but not in groups containing any females. Results point to social enhancement as a promising direction for research exploring factors underlying sex differences in problem drinking.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{fairbairn2015,\n  title = {Speech Volume Indexes Sex Differences in the Social-Emotional Effects of Alcohol},\n  author = {Catharine E.

However, manual coding of such actions is labor intensive and requires extensive training. To date, establishing reliable automated coding of unscripted facial actions has been a daunting challenge impeding development of psychological theories and applications requiring facial expression assessment. It is therefore essential that automated coding systems be developed with enough precision and robustness to ease the burden of manual coding in challenging data involving variation in participant gender, ethnicity, head pose, speech, and occlusion. We report a major advance in automated coding of spontaneous facial actions during an unscripted social interaction involving three strangers. For each participant (n = 80, 47 \\% women, 15 \\% Nonwhite), 25 facial action units (AUs) were manually coded from video using the Facial Action Coding System. Twelve AUs occurred more than 3 \\% of the time and were processed using automated FACS coding. Automated coding showed very strong reliability for the proportion of time that each AU occurred (mean intraclass correlation = 0.89), and the more stringent criterion of frame-by-frame reliability was moderate to strong (mean Matthew's correlation = 0.61). With few exceptions, differences in AU detection related to gender, ethnicity, pose, and average pixel intensity were small. Fewer than 6 \\% of frames could be coded manually but not automatically. These findings suggest automated FACS coding has progressed sufficiently to be applied to observational research in emotion and related areas of study.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2015c,\n  title = {Spontaneous Facial Expression in Unscripted Social Interactions Can Be Measured Automatically},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka ``spontaneous'') facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing,well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required.We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this newdatabase is the first of its kind for the public. Thework promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{zhang2014a,\n  title = {{{BP4D-spontaneous}}: A High-Resolution Spontaneous {{3D}} Dynamic Facial Expression Database},\n  author = {Xing Zhang and Lijun Yin and Jeffrey F.

The rating scale can be configured on a number of parameters including the labels for its upper and lower bounds, its numerical range, and its visual representation. Annotations can be displayed alongside the multimedia file and saved for easy import into statistical analysis software.

Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for FACS action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@article{girard2014a,\n  title = {Nonverbal Social Withdrawal in Depression: {{Evidence}} from Manual and Automatic Analyses},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

Yet, the meaning and function of facial actions often depends in part on their intensity. We propose a part-based, sparse representation for automated measurement of continuous variation in AU intensity. We evaluated its effectiveness in two publically available databases, CK+ and the soon to be released Binghamton high-resolution spontaneous 3D dyadic facial expression database. The former consists of posed facial expressions and ordinal level intensity (absent, low, and high). The latter consists of spontaneous facial expression in response to diverse, well-validated emotion inductions, and 6 ordinal levels of AU intensity. In a preliminary test, we started from discrete emotion labels and ordinal-scale intensity annotation in the CK+ dataset. The algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. These preliminary results supported the utility of the part-based, sparse representation. Second, we applied the algorithm to the more demanding task of continuous AU intensity estimation in spontaneous facial behavior in the Binghamton database. Manual 6-point ordinal coding and continuous measurement were highly consistent. Visual analysis of the overlay of continuous measurement by the algorithm and manual ordinal coding strongly supported the representational power of the proposed method to smoothly interpolate across the full range of AU intensity.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{jeni2013,\n  title = {Continuous {{AU}} Intensity Estimation Using Localized, Sparse Facial Feature Space},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 10th {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Automated Face}} and {{Gesture Recognition}} ({{FG}})},\n  author = {L{\\a'a}szl{\\a'o} A Jeni and Jeffrey M.

Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units, and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity.

These results are consistent with the ``social risk hypothesis'' of depression.

However, there are many potential ways to select a threshold. How do different criteria and metrics compare? Manually FACS coded video of 45 clinical interviews (Spectrum dataset) were processed using person-specific active appearance models (AAM). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained using an independent dataset (RU-FACS). Spectrum sessions were randomly assigned to training (n=32) and testing sets (n=13). Six different threshold selection criteria were compared for automatic A U coding. Three major findings emerged: 1) Thresholds that attempt to balance the confusion matrix (using kappa, F1, or MCC) performed significantly better on all metrics than thresholds that select arbitrary error or accuracy rates (such as TPR, FPR, or EER). 2) AU detection scores for kappa, F1, and MCC were highly intercorrelated; accuracy was uncorrelated with the others. And 3) Kappa, MCC, and Fl were all positively correlated with base rate. They increased with increases in AU base rates. Accuracy, by contrast, showed the opposite pattern. It was strongly negatively correlated with base rate. These findings suggest that better automatic coding can be obtained by using threshold-selection criteria that balance the confusion matrix and benefit from increased AU base rates in the training data.</div>\n<div class=\"payload-bibtex\">@inproceedings{girard2011,\n  title = {Criteria and Metrics for Thresholded {{AU}} Detection},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Computer Vision Workshops}} ({{ICCV Workshops}})},\n  author = {Jeffrey M.

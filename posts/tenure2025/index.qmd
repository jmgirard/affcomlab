In celebration of my promotion in August, I was invited to give a "tenure talk"
to the department of psychology, reflecting on the last five years of my work as
an assistant professor at the University of Kansas. In the slides below, I walk
through my accomplishments, how my research framework has evolved over time, and
provide two examples of my interdisciplinary work: one psychological project
that was enhanced by my computational and quantitative background and one
computational project that was enhanced by my psychological background.
